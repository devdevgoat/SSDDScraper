<p>Last friday reading this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n2e9t9/sec_wants_us_to_give_them_one_chance/">SEC WANTS US TO GIVE THEM ONE CHANCE</a>.</p>
<p>Full SEC speech: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/werewolves-of-change">SEC</a>.</p>
<p>The TLDR done by u/Firetorpedos is very nice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>TLDR</em></strong> On April 28th, the SEC website published a speech that has NOT recieved its due attention from apes. This is a very strong and direct piece, even calling short hedgies "werewolves", and i think by this piece they want to get our attention. This speech delineates, among other things, the parameters of a coming SEC report related to "meme stocks". The speech is way out of SEC historical comfort zone, and it goes to show that they see our <strong>frustration</strong>. Otherwise it wouldn't have been this strong. It is not written in typical SEC-speak either, it is written in the most simple and easily understand (yet precise and legally prudent) way it possibly can. For me, it is very clear that they want to say something like this: "Meme-stock holders (i dont like this designator either, but nevertheless, it is very clear what they mean): we see your <strong>frustration</strong>. We have our eyes on this. Here is our position:  </p>
<p>a) there ARE SHORTIE FUCKERIES related to e.g. GME stocks.  </p>
<p>b) SEC will address it with regulations, that are ALREADY IDENTIFIED.  </p>
<p>c) SEC should NOT give a fuck about hedge/financial institution loosing ALOT of money.  </p>
<p>d) Bonus: LIBOR is fucking done for. [GET A LOAD OF THIS!]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The words frustration gave me something to think about. And thinking I remember that the law SR-NSCC-2021-801(If you don't remember what this law was for I let you this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mm9yci/the_801/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">post</a> that explains very easy and simple) was filled the  03/05/2021. And I remember this other <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc0zfn/too_ape_didnt_read_summary_of_srnscc2021801/">post</a>, that talked about the time that have to pass for the law to be approved automatically.</p>

<p>This post sais 60 days, but remember, <strong>DO YOUR OWN DD, ANYONE CAN BE WRONG</strong>. So i went to the law <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-801.pdf">SR-NSCC-2021-801</a> and checked it myself.</p>
<p>And i got this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>III. Date of Effectiveness of the Advance Notice, and Timing for Commission Action  </p>
<p><strong>The proposed change may be implemented if the Commission does not object to the proposed change within</strong> <strong>60 days of the later of (i) the date that the proposed change  was filed with the Commission or (ii) the date that any additional information requested by the Commission is received.</strong> The clearing agency shall not implement the proposed change if the Commission has any objection to the proposed change. The Commission may extend the period for review by an additional 60 days if the proposed change raises novel or complex issues, subject to the Commission providing the clearing agency with prompt written notice of the extension. A proposed change may be implemented in less than 60 days from the date the advance notice is filed, or the date further information requested by the Commission is received, if the Commission notifies the clearing agency in writing that it does not object to the proposed change and authorizes the clearing agency to implement the proposed change on an earlier date, subject to any conditions imposed by the Commission. The clearing agency shall post notice on its website of proposed changes that are implemented. The proposal shall not take effect until all regulatory actions required with respect to the proposal are completed.  </p>
<p>pg. 58 and 59.</p>

<p>Oh, my ape friend was right</p>
<p><strong>"The proposed change may be implemented if the Commission does not object to the proposed change within 60 days of the later of (i) the date that the proposed change  was filed with the Commission or (ii) the date that any additional information requested by the Commission is received."</strong></p>
