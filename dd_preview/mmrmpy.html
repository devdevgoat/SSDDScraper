<p>Will still stream tomorrow, but will be gone between 10am EDT and 11:15am EDT for a midterm so will pause the stream then.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 29 4:00PM:</strong></p>
<p>Ending around 170.24, down 4.34%. Overall downwards day on low volume. Nothing too crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 28 3:21PM:</strong></p>
<p>Pretty consistent block of buying volume. Possible confirmation of a bounce.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 26 2:42PM:</strong></p>
<p>I've sold my tea leaves on ebay and used the proceeds to buy a share of GME.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 25 2:38PM:</strong></p>
<p>The positive news today has fudged up my timing, but yes, there is a dip cooking right now.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 24 2:37PM:</strong></p>
<p>SSR is at 160.17.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 23 2:32PM:</strong></p>
<p>It's really amusing how shorts can drop the price so much with almost no volume.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 22 2:27PM:</strong></p>
<p>Maybe I need to spend some money on some premium tea leaves.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 21 2:22PM:</strong></p>
<p>I guess there is a discount today after all! Thanks Ken!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 20 2:19PM:</strong></p>
<p>No volume here folks. &lt;60k on average per minute candle. As Uncle Bruce likes to say, "they want to make the stock look awful".</p>
<p>Honestly the stock looks great to me because I like the stock.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 19 2:18PM:</strong></p>
<p>My tea leaves have lied to me.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 18 2:05PM:</strong></p>
<p>Around 10k volume a minute. So low.... A bit higher than yesterday but it's still crazy low.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 17 1:47PM:</strong></p>
<p>I'm reading my tea leaves right now and it says double bottom.</p>

<p>GME trading like a penny stock again. Such low volume!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 14 1:02PM:</strong></p>
<p>Prediction for the day: - - - - - - - -&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Edit 13 12:35PM:</strong></p>
<p>As for option sonar, these puts were sold. So nothing bad. Typically a bullish sign.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 12 12:30PM:</strong></p>
<p>Basically a split itself doesn't trigger covering. But a recall of shares to vote on a split would. Scratch out point B, now that I think about it, they will have covered anyways before the split happens. Correct me if I'm wrong. So the cheaper price shouldn't factor in. However it is good for post squeeze, as retail can buy in cheaply.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 11 12:16PM:</strong></p>
<p>Let's talk strategy.</p>
<p>IV seems to have a hard time going any lower. They will likely keep this trading sideways until the next catalyst.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/rszdaggq5zr61.png?width=2124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df0482e9c06768752a667fadbf65ad026a7c82d5</p>
<p>My best guess is <strong>a share recall for a stock split. This is pure speculation but this would be a great move in my opinion. A) it forces shorts to cover. B) (edit) it makes the stock cheap so tons of retail can buy back in post squeeze.</strong> This seems like a perfect infinity squeeze setup as well as a good post squeeze recovery.</p>
<p>Will we continue to trade sideways into 4/16? Yes that's possible. All for the sake of keeping IV low. This largely depends on if they do a share recall announcement, and when.</p>
<p><strong>My best guess for the future, is that IF a share recall is announced, we may see some major action. Most probably sometime between next week and 4/20... blaze it ;) !</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edit 10 12:04PM:</strong></p>
<p>Please read the recall post :D</p>
<p><strong>Edit 9 11:46AM:</strong></p>
<p>Since I didn't have time to read on stream, I read it now and would like you all to do the same, <strong>please read this about contacting your brokers and the share recall:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit 8 11:28AM:</strong></p>
<p>Ok stream is back up, the YouTube editing tools kind of suck. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih79GhTXRdA&amp;ab_channel=WardenElite">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih79GhTXRdA&amp;ab_channel=WardenElite</a></p>
<p><strong>Edit 7 11:21AM:</strong></p>
<p><strong>New support added at 174.</strong></p>
<p>We seemed to have bottomed out.</p>

<p>Edit 6 11:20AM:</p>
<p>Gonna just trim out the roofing hammering parts so I've made the stream inaccessible for a bit. I'll have it back up later today.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 5 10:26AM:</strong></p>
<p>Seems it's the 40% chance option. I don't think we will get a 5%-10% discount, but we can dip further.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 4 9:56AM:</strong></p>
<p>We'll likely see an ascending channel soon. 9:50AM seemed to have happened.</p>

<p>Important points on the Form 8k.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2 9:34AM:</strong></p>
<p>Swing traders exiting at open. Nothing too crazy. Almost 1 million volume first minute. Pretty decent volume.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1 9:18AM:</strong></p>
<p>Sorry <strong>I will not be streaming today</strong>. My neighbors are doing roof repair and it's loud as heck. They are straight up replaced their entire roof so there's going to be banging and sawing all day.</p>

<h1>Begin Reading Here</h1>
<p>Gooooooood morning my beautiful silverback apes!</p>
<p>Ah yes. The 10% odds have hit. <strong>No discount today my friends :D</strong></p>
<p>To quote myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Forget options chain, forget TA, what's coming soon is <strong>a chain of business maneuvers that can push the price.</strong> So whether that be a share recall, <strong>a change in leadership</strong>, big business changes are underway. Eventually we'll likely walk out of the eye of the storm, and get flung into the sky and catch a rocket to the moon :D</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like Cohen and Grube have just leveled up. Melvin and friends' plan to short today just got STOMPED. It's like Cohen picked up the invincibility power up and now he's stomping the hell out of the shorts.</p>
