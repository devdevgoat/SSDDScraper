<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt4j8w/shitadel_hq_oddly_busy_right_now_on_a_weekend/">Reddit: Google Maps showig activity in Citadel HQ</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Citadel+Enterprises+America's+LLC/@41.8801637,-87.6282023,19z/data=!3m1!5s0x880e2cbcb2674a9d:0x424899df3c9d2a63!4m5!3m4!1s0x880e2cbca3176469:0xb50c07f9bb38b9c1!8m2!3d41.8797542!4d-87.6291641">Google Maps link to Citadel HQ</a>.</p>
<p>On Google Maps it appears there was activity (and a lot, simply a few phones wouldn't have triggered Google to say there was activity at the HQ) at Citadel's HQ after hours.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Cryptocurrencies just took a MASSIVE dump</strong>. Something crypto has NEVER seen before. Crypto is volatile, but this was unprecedented. I've been in crypto since 2017 and never seen anything like this. Bitcoin dumped from $59,000 to $51,000 in less than 20 minutes.</p>
<p><em>[[</em><strong>INLINE EDIT</strong><em>: cryptocurrency dump may be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mt6cq5/ok_so_this_is_the_reason_for_the_dip/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">unrelated</a> BUT </em><em>that doesn't matter</em><em>. If the Tweet is accurate, we can almost be sure that explains why there is currently activity at Citadel HQ. Check my final edit, there's insane activity at Citadel HQ right now.]]</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>The timing of this Tweet AND CITADEL HQ ACTIVITY confirms to me that these 2 events are definitely related, and brings validity to these rumours.</p>
<p>I think HUGE news is about to drop boys. These charges will be very, very fucking interesting.</p>
<p>Explained GME to a couple of my family members and showed them some DDs like the everything short and we are buying in again on Monday (especially because DFV doubled down, I regret not doubling down with him before and now he has given us the opportunity again). I'm an XXX holder from late last year and I'm not selling until I make at least $100,000,000 from this. The global economy is about to crash and GME is our hedge against it.</p>
<p>Load up on tendies autists, this week might be insane.</p>
<p>edit: added Google Maps link to Citadel HQ.</p>
<p>edit 2: HOLY FUCK. <strong>THEY ARE STILL AT CITADEL HQ</strong>. I just realised the RED BAR is the LIVE activity. It literally shows the CURRENT activity. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/H4GBOBD.png">LOOK AT THIS SCREENSHOT.</a> It shows there is STILL people at Citadel HQ. It's 1AM in Chicago. They have been there SINCE the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt4j8w/shitadel_hq_oddly_busy_right_now_on_a_weekend/">last post</a> which was made 3-4 hours ago.</p>
<p>edit 3: Someone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt6rop/kenny_and_the_boys_working_late_on_saturday_huh/">got a picture of the lights on</a> in their HQ. Easy raid or employees shredding docs? <a href="https://i.imgur.com/HxMpmYh.jpg">Here is another picture of the lights on from less than 20 minutes ago</a>.</p>
<p>edit 4: WHAT THE FUCK! <a href="https://i.imgur.com/jL7NtGK.png">THERE IS MORE ACTIVITY AT CITADEL HQ RIGHT NOW AT 2 AM THAN THE PEAK ACTIVITY IS EVER DURING THE ENTIRE DAY FOR SATURDAY</a></p>
<p>edit 5: removed a paragraph talking about the cryptocurrency dump because it's UNRELATED. There is CRAZY activity at Citadel HQ right now, and if the Tweet is real it might be related</p></content></body>
