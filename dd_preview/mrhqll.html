<content><p>I keep seeing posts like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mrc7qf/no_dates_stay_focused_remember_march_and_how_they/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this one</a> saying that 'they' used dates to bring us down back in March.  Or posts talking about shills and FUD and heavier moderation for MOASS like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mr28a6/this_guy_semerien_knows_whats_up_ignore_the_fud/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this one</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mr386y/increasing_karma_requirements_for_the_sub_during/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this one</a>.</p>
<p>The simple truth of the matter is that we have tons of misinformation and confirmation bias floating around and we're just FUDding ourselves. The perfect example is the dividend nonsense which flew around the sub like a whirlwind before people finally found the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mqmsvf/re_gamestop_2021_dividends_speculation/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">good DD</a>. </p>
<p>The same goes for this wild information going around about share recalls.  Both Fidelity and Vanguard have provided different dates for a 'recall'.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mpduvh/i_know_we_dont_do_dates_but_i_have_a_feeling_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">Vanguard is supposedly</a> expecting a recall on 4/20 while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/mqz9ne/hot_topic_gamestop_corp_gme_proxy_voting/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Fidelity has flat out said that the Record Date is today 04/15</a>. . These posts with varying dates are contradictory and leading to FUD.  </p>
<p>Let me break it down.  </p>
<p>Last year Hestia Capital <strong>ESTIMATED</strong> the Record Date to be 04/20 in a 14a filing on 04/06. They wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to information GameStop has provided to custodial banks, brokers and other intermediaries, we <strong>BELIEVE</strong> GameStop has set a record date of Monday, April 20 for the 2020 Annual Meeting.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Record Date wasn't released until 04/27 in the Definitive Proxy Statement which is 7 days <strong>AFTER</strong> the Record Date and 2 weeks after Hestia estimated the date. This year no one related to the company has filed documents to identify the Record Date ahead of time.  Instead, we only have responses from a handful of broker's customer support that highlight 04/15 and 04/20. </p>
<p>The problem with the Vanguard and Fidelity dates is that if Fidelity says the Record Date is 04/15 then all shares must have been recalled by that date.  That also means that Vanguard's date of 04/20 cannot possibly be a recall date, since it is 5 days past the Record Date.</p>
<p><strong>WHY HAS THIS CREATED FUD?</strong></p>
<p>There have been countless posts on share recalls and, most importantly, BlackRock recalling shares.  I've seen posts everywhere and all over Twitter this morning.  I'm not going to link to any of them because I'm sure you've seen them all by now.  </p>
<p>There was so much misinformation going around about GME recalling all shares or validating shares which was just false. Then, after everyone has been screaming about not using dates, people start posting meme after meme about McDonald's Day, or Tweets from DFV or Cohen with some wild Tinfoil theories about diamond swords and companies in a picture being related to overstock who issued a crypto dividend so suddenly 04/15 and 04/20 are huge dates. </p>
<p><strong>THESE POSTS WERE NOT MADE BY SHILLS. THEY WERE MADE BY US.  BY PEOPLE WHO REGULARLY POST IN THIS SUB AND ON TWITTER.</strong></p>
<p>Back to the FUD.  There have been several posts like this one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mr5s1k/blackrock_vanguard_and_fidelity_are_going_to_nuke/">from last night</a> that are still theorizing that BlackRock and Vanguard will cause the squeeze with a share recall.  Despite there being <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mmt5rq/420_share_recall_explained_why_its_important_that/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">posts like this one</a> that attempted to nail down the Record Date. I didn't even see this one and its many, many edits till just now. Something like that should have been pinned as something to read before posting about a share recall or posting about dates.   </p>
<p>All of this means that shares need to be in their possession by <strong>END OF DAY TODAY.</strong>  That also means that shorts would have had to have covered by <strong>04/13</strong> to have shares settled by today.  That means that posts like the one from last night, while hopeful and exciting, did nothing but create a FUD opportunity.  </p>
<p>Everyone is expecting 04/15 and 04/20 to be huge dates because of all the memes, the fun 4/20 6/9 blaze it jokes, and all the DD that gets blasted to the front page without any fact checking or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mq1g5e/vanguard_dont_have_voting_rights_for_most_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">counter DD</a>.  These are all documents that has been available for weeks and months now...</p>
<p>04/15 is going to come and go without any huge movements from share recalls and people are going to be depressed and sad that absolutely nothing happened. <strong>That's FUD</strong>.  </p>
<p><strong>MY POINT</strong></p>
<p>I think we need to see way more moderation for the DD and maybe cut back on the memes that are hiding good DD.  I keep seeing people saying to do your own DD, which I get is hard, but at the very least, stop mindlessly upvoting DD anytime you see rocketships or a feel-good theory...</p>
<p><strong>TL:DR</strong></p>
<p>We make our own FUD with lazy DD and wishful thinking.  </p>
<p>We need to stop sharing memes with dates because they get thrown around like facts.</p>
<p>It's not the date that's the problem it's the bad DD.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I wanted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mrhqll/were_creating_our_own_fud_a_plea_for_more/gunbeyy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3">highlight this comment about the dates for record and recall as information that I hadn’t seen before.</a></p></content></body>
