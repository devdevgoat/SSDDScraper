<content><p>It recently occurred to me that in WSB, it’s against the rules to post about penny stocks, so not a lot of you follow the price action.</p>
<p>I'm a day trader and my trading strategy focuses entirely on penny stocks that are owned by hedge funds known to manipulate the market. Most stocks I invest in are all complete garbage, but I look for pump and dumps, obvious manipulation patterns, and anticipate runners based on near-identical charts of multiple companies.</p>
<p>I haven’t paid much attention to any of the stocks on my main watchlist since January, because I went all-in on GME. What I did notice though, is that my watchlist has been red, since early February. There are some green days in there and many days that trade sideways, so it didn’t feel like they were completely tanking, but they're definitely all tanking.</p>
<p>Last night I decided to actually to take a deeper look into the charts. They all started going down at the same time in early February with no real spikes, just bleeding. They all follow a similar trend as well.</p>
<p>Below are most of the stocks (YTD charts) I’ve invested in, in the past year. And let me make this clear because this is an important detail — <strong>I didn’t just select certain stocks that look similar on my watchlist. These are literally all the stocks on my watchlists, besides GME, AMC, NOK, and BB. I’m not picking and choosing the ones that look similar to make strengthen a claim.</strong></p>

<p>If investment banks and hedge funds didn’t report record quarters and the market hasn’t held at record highs, I could possibly believe there might be a rational explanation for dozens of stocks, some in completely different sectors, to trend downward for months in similar patterns. But that simply is not true.</p>
<p>I spend hours looking at charts every day. I am very familiar with the trend line for every single one of the stocks in my watchlist; if you were to print out a 1-year chart of every one of these stocks, without labeling them, I’m pretty confident that I could tell you the company associated with every chart. So I assure you, the trends are not normal.</p>
<p>Here’s my theory: The mass sell-off is definitely not going towards covering the shorts, instead it's paying for interest, pump and dumps, and the capital needed to purchase the blocks of shares they’d sell off to drive down the price. They were able to get away with it because people don’t tend to follow a bunch of garbage stocks, and since penny stocks are known to be extremely volatile, it doesn't raise any eyebrows when one tanks 30-50% in a short timespan, or even in a single day. And media outlets don’t really look into penny stocks too much. </p>
<p>Also, this is entirely speculation, but I’ve also noticed that when penny stocks cool down they will trade sideways for weeks. Understandable if there’s low volume, but sometimes there are days when the volume will randomly be extremely high, but the price remains stagnant and there’s no news whatsoever to explain the high volume. It seems like an algorithm keeps the price bouncing back and forth, propping it up. But they aren’t bouncing back and forth, they’re just bleeding. HFs may have run out of money to prop up the stocks, so that’s why they’re sinking. Again, this is speculation, I don’t know what really goes on behind the curtain.</p>
<p>TL;DR: My watchlist is full of stocks that HFs manipulate and there have mass sell-offs of every single one since February, even though we’re experiencing record highs in the market for months.</p></content></body>
