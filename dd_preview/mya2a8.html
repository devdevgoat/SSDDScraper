<content><p>The purpose of this DD is to look at the  outcome if there are many more votes cast at the shareholder meeting than GME shares that are issued and outstanding. I have a background in corporate and securities law, but this is not legal advice (for GME or for apes). Just a recording of one random apes research on a topic of this ape’s own interest.</p>
<p><em>The assumption for this DD is that there will be more votes cast or otherwise represented at the shareholder meeting than GME shares that are issued and outstanding. It that doesn’t happen, everything that follows it moot.</em> </p>
<p><strong>My first question is how many votes are counted?</strong> </p>
<p>You can’t count more votes than the number of shares outstanding, but you also can’t discount shareholder’s legitimate right to vote. </p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from a commentary by lawyers at Latham &amp; Watkins, a prominent top tier corporate law firm (<a href="https://www.lw.com/upload/pubContent/_pdf/pub1878_1.Commentary.Empty.Voting.pdf">https://www.lw.com/upload/pubContent/_pdf/pub1878_1.Commentary.Empty.Voting.pdf</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Borrowed Shares and Over-Voting. A frequently occurring phenomenon is where the same share is voted twice. This is commonly the result of the vast increase in share lending that now permeates the equity markets. Developed in the context of short sales, the practice of share lending has mushroomed in recent years and frequently represents a significant source of income for investors and for brokers and other custodians. By custom and contract, the shares being lent are accompanied by full voting rights, so that the party borrowing the stock or its transferee can vote the shares which it holds on a record date. If, however, as frequently happens the lending party is a custodian which does not allocate the lent shares to and notify specific beneficial account holders, it is possible that both the lending beneficial owner and the borrower will vote the shares and over-voting will occur. Nor will over-voting be readily noticed if the total number of proxies cast by the custodian does not exceed its book position at the record date.  </p>
<p>Historically, where over-voting has resulted in a custodian voting more proxies than its record position on the record date, <strong>the vote has been “corrected” by the inspector of elections to reduce the obvious over-vote</strong>. More recently, the NYSE [Greysweats Note: GME trades on the NYSE.] has embarked on a compliance campaign with its member firms to insure more accurate record keeping of share lending and borrowing, including attribution to underlying beneficial holders, to eliminate over-voting. Whether the enforcement campaign will succeed and whether it will affect the practices of the many custodians that are not NYSE member firms remains to be seen.  </p>
<p>Even if over-voting is eliminated, the ability of market participants to “buy” votes by borrowing shares will not be affected. This, like so many of the problems surrounding shareholder democracy today, has not been invented by hedge funds. But it is increasingly being used by hedge funds to further their economic interests. Record date “capture” of the vote is relatively inexpensive because stock lending fees are modest and because once the record date has passed the borrower can return the shares to its lender. As a consequence, this source of “empty voting,” unless regulated, is likely to grow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so this means that the inspector of elections (judge of elections in the UK, scrutineer in Canada) will correct the vote in their official tallying of the votes cast at the meeting so that it doesn’t exceed the issued and outstanding shares. Who is the inspector of elections? These are companies that are hired by the issuer (in this case GME) to manage and certify votes cast at shareholder meetings. </p>
<p>So let’s start to play this out. GME will know how many votes are cast, because their hired inspector of elections will tally all votes cast and will compare records of all shareholder votes cast with the share register of the company (remember, the largest shareholder on the share register will be Cede &amp; Co., lots of diligence on that in this subreddit for you to understand registered ownership vs beneficial ownership). This is the most important takeaway. The Board will have hard evidence of fraudulent trading activity that has resulted in the creation and ownership of GME shares that were not properly issued by the company. </p>
<p><strong>Will this impact the outcome of the vote?</strong> </p>
<p>This is a normal shareholder meeting with uncontested matters for approval. No, this will not impact the vote. I have no reason to believe all matters recommended for approval by the board will not be approved by a majority of the votes cast at the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Will this trigger the MOASS and get me tendies?</strong></p>
<p>Not directly. Remember the commentary from Latham: historically, the vote is simply corrected. </p>
<p>They note that the NYSE has stepped up compliance activities around this problem. GME is trading on the NYSE, so hard evidence of this (like a shareholder vote count) will be of interest to them. Realistically, the NYSE is not likely to take any actions that would force a margin call. Someone more familiar with NYSE rules around this might give better insight.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, so how does this help?</strong> </p>
<p>Can the Board then do a share recall? To my knowledge, there isn’t a mechanism for that. On the books of GME, there are 70 million issued and outstanding shares. The creation of these additional shares is through the mess of DTCC/naked short selling exemptions for market makers and GME does not have authority to step in to directly recall its shares from Cede &amp; Co. or otherwise in connection with that clearing and settlement system.</p>
<p>Here’s what I would suggest if I were on the Board: Since the Board has hard evidence a minimum number of fraudulent shares that are outstanding, I would recommend GME issues a press release announcing the results of the shareholder meeting (which is a normal event to press release) and I would include a note that the inspector of elections was required to correct the vote because 75/80/100/etc. million votes were cast even though there are only 70 million shares are issued and outstanding. I would add that the company will take all actions the Board considers prudent to ensure the interests of its shareholders are protected and to maximize shareholder value. That’s the mic drop. No mention of a short squeeze, All facts, so there’s no liability associated with unproven claims.</p>
<p>A press release like that confirms the shorts did not cover (common misconception propagated by the news). That would put the SEC and the NYSE on notice that this has happened without question (and it cannot be swept under the rug) and needs to be investigated and resolved immediately. That would put the lenders on notice that their hedgie with a significant short position is looking pretty terrifying for their bottom line (see Credit Suisse $5.5B loss relates to Archegos implosion) and might have them re-evaluate when the appropriate time is for a margin call to reduce their risk. This might also generate renewed retail interest (from non-ape retail investors who were believing the MSM narrative that the GME short squeeze issue ended in January), which would create increased pressure towards a squeeze.</p>
<p><strong>This is also why each shareholder should vote all of their shares without exception.</strong></p>
<p>TL;DR: Over-voting does not directly and immediately trigger a share recall or force shorts to cover. It does provide the company with information on the total votes cast, which it could use as evidence of massive naked shorting of its shares and consequently the fraudulent creation of millions of shares. The company may publicize this information, which would refute the narrative that all shorts covered and would put the SEC and the NYSE on notice that this has happened and needs to be investigated and resolved immediately. <strong>Vote your shares.</strong></p></content></body>
