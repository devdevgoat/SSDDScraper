<content><h1>EDIT: I have posted an updated, further-depth overview of all DTC filings <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/mtw35e/filings_from_the_dtc_whos_who_and_whats_what/">here</a>, and will be posting NSCC and OCC filings this week.</h1>
<p>Someone mentioned in a comment that they got all of the recent SEC filings mixed up so I slapped this together really quick. Hopefully it helps.</p>
<p>Big ups to u/c-digs who wrote nearly everything linked. If one of my summaries is hella wrong please let me know and I will fix it! </p>
<p>Here’s a quick and dirty rundown:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/mtw35e/filings_from_the_dtc_whos_who_and_whats_what/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">DTC-002</a> — Measures counterparty risk by their equity in addition to their credit rating, so tighter upper limit on amount of capital secured by smaller, less capitalized entities. As far as I understand it means members can’t keep too much of their money / securities in smaller banks. Same as NSCC-003 and FICC-001. (submitted for approval 3/10, approved 4/16 and now in effect)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m793h7/new_dtcc_rule_just_passed_in_effect_immediatly/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">DTC-003</a> — Reconcile your statements with your books every day instead of every month. (submitted for immediate approval and accepted 3/16)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgs05i/analysis_of_srdtc2021004_dtcc_changing_the_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">DTC-004</a> — Emergency plan for what to do if one of our members gets liquidated to shit fuck and puts us all at risk (submitted for immediate approval and accepted on 3/29)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mibedc/the_moass_wont_happen_until_options_are_not/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">DTC-005</a> - When a share is lent it gets marked as on loan and the person who borrowed it can’t lend it out again (submitted for approval on 4/1)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc0zfn/too_ape_didnt_read_summary_of_srnscc2021801/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">NSCC-002</a> (also 801) — Margin call your ass into the milky way (advance notice given on 3/5, submitted for approval on 3/18)</p>
<p>NSCC-003 — Same as DTC-002</p>
<p>NSCC-004 — Same as DTC-004</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgus2l/rc_announcement_going_to_send_stonk_to_da_moon/gswzxsa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3">OCC-003</a> (also 801) — The OCC is adding funds from its default waterfall to create a “minimum skin in the game” deposit, which i think means that a portion of their excess capital is going into the “in case of liquidation break this box first” fund and if i’m understanding <em>that</em> right it puts the OCC members more on the hook than the OCC itself when one of the members has liabilities that spill over, but i’m not 100% sure on that one do if someone could clear that up for me it would really help! (advance notice given on 2/10, submitted for approval 2/24, notice of pls give more time given on 4/6, notice of no objection (to the rule change not the time extension) by the sec filed 4/7)</p>
