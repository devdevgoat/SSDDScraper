<content><p>Hello apes/retards,</p>
<p>I'd like to provide an <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mp7zbn/blackrock_is_about_to_delete_shitadel_out_of/">update to my previous post</a> which outlines the possibility that BlackRock is in the process of deleting Shitadel out of existence. As of this morning, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pzxjUR8.png">FINRA has reported no major material changes</a> to its list of major institutional shareholders. However, it maintains the position of <em>BlackRock Fund Advisors</em> at &amp; around 14 million shares. </p>
<p>For the past few weeks, I've been periodically reviewing the <a href="https://sec.report/CIK/0001006249">SEC's page on BlackRock's subsidiary firm</a> in the hopes that a 13G or 13F would pop up indicating of the change in ownership. However, I've been unable to locate any such publication. Additionally, I've been reviewing some of its holdings in order to better understand how BlackRock structures &amp; files its security purchases/sales via ETFs held by said affiliate. For example, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IJR/holdings?p=IJR">IJR is a GME-holding ETF</a> of which <a href="https://fintel.io/i/blackrock-fund-advisors">BlackRock Fund Advisors</a> owns a portion of.</p>
<p>My understanding of the situation thus far, (please correct me if any of this detail is inaccurate), is that BlackRock Fund Advisors is a holding firm for BlackRock Inc that maintains positions in ETFs/MFs/IFs/Bonds, of which is managed directly or indirectly via BlackRock Inc and/or any of its affiliates. If &amp; when an ETF managed by BlackRock changes its position in a security like GME, said position change would be recorded &amp; published by BlackRock Inc via an SC-13G, (as BFA defers equity management to BlackRock Inc via 13F-NTs). However, said change in ownership would be captured &amp; published differently in FINRAs Major Shareholder section, (as its BFA that is the parent company with majority ownership in ETFs which own stake in GME). </p>
<p>This discrepancy in equity ownership would explain why 13Gs aren't being filed by BFA, but why it remains present on FINRAs Major Shareholder list. Now, some of you may be skeptical of FINRA/MorningStar and its data, but it seems to be accurate, (at least from our understanding of its function in aggregating and calculating position changes via forms filed by said affiliates and the SEC). Additionally, FINRA/MorningStar would be committing <em>insane levels of fraud</em> if said data were wholly inaccurate. Again, <strong>said data must have some level of verifiability; otherwise, every financial law firm would collectively sue them into oblivion for mis-representing positions held by major corporations and funds</strong>.  Suffice to say, there is an argument to be made in the thesis that BlackRock Fund Advisors indirectly owns a portion of GME via its partial ownership in ETFs managed by BlackRock Inc. </p>
<p>This would mean that BlackRock owns 9 million shares of GME via its grandparent company BlackRock Inc, yet it also owns another 14 million shares via its ETFs which are represented by BlackRock Fund Advisor's position in FINRA, (or an approximation of share ownership by its subsidiaries vs ETF ownership between said affiliates). Remember also that we've been tracking the # of borrowable ETF shares, and that average fluctuates in the millions on a daily/weekly basis. Those shares can only come from a specific collection of ETFs of which BlackRock/Vanguard have a majority ownership in. Additionally, only a major firm with full ownership of its ETFs would be able to dictate low interest rates for such high volumes in borrowable ETF shares. </p>
<p>It could be that BlackRock or Vanguard are lending shares out via its ETFs on low interest because they are aware that GME is undervalued and overshorted. They intended for said shares to be borrowed by SHFs to continue its FTD cycle, and in an attempt to increase the SI% by having itself/competing longwhales/retail buy the synthetics. BlackRock/Vanguard ETFs would then buy more synthetics and continue this cycle over and over. Maybe BlackRock was only lending shares from its ETFs and never intended for said ETFs to vote during the meeting, and subsequently never recalled those shares. Yet. </p>
<p>TLDR: BlackRock &amp; friends are driving this clown car around the block and are ready to fuck Shitadel &amp; those dumbass shithead SHFs harder than ever before. </p>

<p>Edit: Removing the P.S. because it's in bad taste. Let's remain positive and focus on aggregating quality data!</p></content></body>
