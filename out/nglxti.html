<content><p>I think that Robinhood has a big problem on their hands (no surprises there). Maybe I never understood PFOF until now, but here is a breakdown of how they were <strong>stealing my money and fudging the receipts</strong> when I bought <strong>fractional shares</strong> with them.  I would highly recommend that anyone else who bought fractional shares of GME from Robinhood, and then transferred to another broker, check the reported costs.</p>
<h1>On Jan 27, 2021 I opened a Robinhood account and spent $300 on fractional shares of GME right at market close and into after market hours. I never had an account before this date.</h1>

<p>Like many others, after discovering how bad of a brokerage that Robinhood was, I decided to switch. I transferred all of my securities over to JP Morgan's YouInvest (one of the few brokerages that did not limit buying or selling of GME in January) in March. It has taken until recently for the cost basis information to show up in my new account. I've seen recently that people were posting some discrepancies in the way their shares were transferred over-- particularly the cost basis. So I decided to check mine.</p>

<h1>To reiterate, I made my RH account on 1/27/21. There is no way that I could have purchased GME with them on 1/13/21. But wait, there's more...</h1>
<p><em>Just look at those</em> <strong><em>unit costs</em></strong>. That was the cost of a full share that RH is saying that they purchased a fraction of on my behalf. But on Jan 13, 2021 the price of GME was <strong>nowhere near</strong> that.</p>

So these unit costs reported by RH are fake and made up to make the numbers make sense.</a></p>
<h1>The full breakdown looks like this:</h1>

<h1>TL;DR Robinhood stole $50 from me and then fudged the dates and unit costs for my fractional shares in order for the numbers to make any sense. The way the purchases were recorded on my RH account documents and the way that they were reported to JP Morgan Chase are different. I never even had a Robinhood account on January 13th, 2021. If RH would have spent my $300 on 1/13/21 like these documents say, at the highest GME price, I would have owned 7.76 shares. Based on the reports that THEY sent to my new broker and the closing price of GME today, they owe me $1,360.</h1>
<p><strong>P.S. The true cost of trading &lt;1 share of GME with Robinhood in January was $50. Not free at all.</strong></p></content></body>
