<p>MAY 7th Edit: They have postponed the ruling until June 21st, please see my followup post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n6zgng/nsc002_delayed_for_longer_period_of_comment_and/</p>
<p>I haven't seen as much talk about this, yet it is the biggest news to come and IT IS the endgame catalyst.</p>
<p>NSCC-801 Passed with no objections yesterday. For this rule to enter effect it needs to piggyback on NSCC-002, which if no objections are made again, will be passed this Friday. Let me remind you just how powerful 801 really is...</p>
<p>Once 801 enters effect, all hedgefunds holding short positions will be monitored Every. Single. Minute. They will have to report EVERY SINGLE MINUTE their value in short positions versus their actual money on hand. If they fail to report or their short position value crosses the threshold where it is higher than their money on hand, it is an immediate warning to deposit the funds needed to cover within ONE HOUR. Failure to do so leads to the NSCC immediately overriding operations and liquidating the hedge funds entirely, one after another until all that is left is the trillions in insurance.</p>
<p>This is bigger than anything, This is so big, that this rule will prevent a squeeze even a fraction of this magnitude from happening ever again. It is that powerful, and with its implementation of this stage of the game... good lord.</p>
<p>If NSCC-002 passes this Friday we have officially entered the squeeze. Hedgefunds will be on a leash that gets tighter the more they pull. Starting in after hours and following into Monday, they will be under so much pressure and restriction that one of two outcomes occur:</p>
<p>1.) Their ability to short will be at such a minimum that our buying power will just break through sell walls and the price will just continue to rise and rise until they can no longer afford to suffer the loss and margin comes a calling, or.</p>
<p>2.) There will be strong final blows of sell off aggression and shorting, literally out of pure ignorance and recklessness which will activate NSCC-801, and thus the great fall of the hedgies via margin call.</p>
<p>If 002 passes this Friday, 801 will catapult us into uncharted waters, never before and never again. I am going to run through a wall Friday if 002 passes. That will be the true beginning of the end.  Buy as much as you can this week. I expect the lowest price to be on Thursday or Friday pending the objection/no objection clause on 002. Hold. You hold like this will never happen again in your life because if 002 passes I can assure you that will be the case.  Practice your breathing when this takes off.</p>
<p>Edit: as brockm20 said in the comments below:</p>
<p>Remember they passed the rule that changed reporting from once a month to anytime for any reason. They can be spot audit unlimited times and for them to run under the radar will require their books to be radioactive.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I threw this up to let everyone know what is up with the end game posts and the severity of the situation. Nobody knows OP. It's not about OP. It's about digesting the information here.</p>
<p>FINAL EDIT:</p>
<p>Yes, DTC-004 and the OCC filings are going to be important - BUT the 801 would NOT be passed and approved without having everything else coming down the pipeline. It makes no sense to have a deadline for NSCC-002 approaching, approve the 801, and NOT have any plan for the other regulations. We may not see any price movement until the other regulations are passed, but the fact that 801 is a go ahead means to me that 002 will be as well; domino effect.</p></content></body>
