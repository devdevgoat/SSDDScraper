<p>HMMMMMMMMMMMM</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Sure seems like someone is scrambling to reconcile their books on behalf of their Prime Brokerage clients i.e. institutional investors and hedge funds.</p>
<p>Note this is a LONG-TERM CONTRACT role so it seems they are expecting a lot of work for the foreseeable future. BNP was also recently involved in a money laundering scheme in Gabon but since this specifically mentions derivatives experience I don't think it's related to that.</p>
<p>Could this have anything to do with Robinhood's recent cost basis fuckery? Perhaps they're not the only ones having trouble unwinding this mess of fraudulent GME shares?</p>
<p>What do APE think?  </p>
<p>I googled the above and found a few other postings on linkedin so they must be working with multiple consultancy firms. Here is one of them:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/operations-analyst-at-software-guidance-assistance-inc-sga-inc-2540015080">https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/operations-analyst-at-software-guidance-assistance-inc-sga-inc-2540015080</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Feel free to rip this apart if you know more; I'm just an ape fighting for the cause of making scumbag billionaires like Ken Kaniff from Connecticut into former billionaires one GME share at a time.</p>
<p>On a totally unrelated note, but also kinda related, I transferred all of my positions from E*Trade to Vanguard this week and everything BUT my GME Shares came through, options contracts were fine. </p>
<p>For some reason, my GME Shares are in the ether but It's too early in the transfer process to know whether fuckery is afoot. I guess I'll know more when I see my cost basis. Will update.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>TLDR: Banks appear to be trying to cover their asses by paying a lot of money to outside consultants to reconcile their likely clusterfucked trade data. Most likely as a direct result of the new DTCC/SEC rules putting pressure on them to do so.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Funny what happens when people do their fucking job üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</strong> </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>P.S. I reached out to the recruiter to schedule an interview. I'll divulge more info if I make it that far in the interview process lmao</p>
<p>Edit: some apes have correctly pointed out that this prob doesn‚Äôt mean anything on its own and I agree that‚Äôs why It‚Äôs just possible DD. </p>
<p>I still think there‚Äôs a lot of recon value given that the language in the description seemed very specific to the discussions we‚Äôve been having here.</p>
<p>As others pointed out, in a vacuum a job description might just be a standard position they post from time to time but if we start seeing more of these pop up from banks, it can be a kind of canary in the coal mine that banks are scrambling.</p>
<p>Like a slightly more sophisticated version of the watch the lights on the buildings thing ppl have been doing lol</p>
<p>To that end, I‚Äôm gonna paste u/chuckfina74 ‚Äòs comment below since I think it can turn this info into something more actionable:</p>
<p>*This is a way tech companies reverse engineer what their competitors are up to as well.</p>
<p>Databases such as Indeed and Glassdoor are a good place for OSINT.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMaybe SWIM should automate tracking financial job descriptions.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôd focus on contractors, because any company involved in shady stuff is sure as shit going to terminate anyone who finds bad stuff, and it‚Äôs easier to ‚Äúend a contact‚Äù than it is to get HR and lawyers involved in FTE terminations.‚Äú*</p></content></body>
