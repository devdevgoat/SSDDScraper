<content><p><strong>(Skip to !!!!!!! - This was the initial part of my investigation. Skip to that bit. Promise.)</strong></p>
<p>In the linked in profile, they are advertising for one position in China with email domains for <a href="https://glacierchina.com">glacierchina.com</a></p>
<p>Running the advertisement through Google Translate, we can see that they have a public <strong>WeChat account: GlacierCap.</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the rest of the job post, they refer themselves to <strong>Gengxin Capital</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Introduction:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Founded in September 2018, Gengxin Capital is an enabling boutique investment bank. The founding team comes from core members of companies such as LAZARD, Yuanhe Chenkun, Kaisheng Rongying, Huafeng Capital, Blue Lotus Research Institute, Analysys International, and has extensive contacts in the capital market, Internet, and technology industries.</p>
<p>Gengxin Capital is committed to deep participation and long-term empowerment in the value creation and value discovery of technological innovation companies that are the engine of global economic growth and unicorns generated in the tide of inclusive consumption in China. Since its establishment, it has assisted 26 projects to complete financing, with a total financing of 5.36 billion yuan.</p>

<p>Additional information I can tell you about the Chinese domain is that while it was initially registered in 2018, the Registry of the domain (RDAP) has been updated within the last 24 hours. Circumstantial, but the domain for the Chinese email accounts do not have anything else allocated to them other than their emails.{"eventAction":"last update of RDAP database","eventDate":"2021-03-14T06:57:12Z"}]</p>

<p>Bringing it back to Glacier Capital in Lux, I ran a WHOIS on the Domain and got a different address than u/timmmmmmmyy.</p>
<p>Domain name holder</p>
<p>GLACIER CAPITAL SARL</p>

<p>Wonderful, modern house. Could hold 4 employees in the silo looking part next door, but otherwise a suburban street.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The official business registration yields the same address as u/timmmmmmmyy</p>
<p>Buisness ID: B212426</p>
<p>A new player has entered the game, <strong>Norbert Raymond Becker.</strong> Owns 48.08% of Glacier Capital, where Marc-Francois Joseph Daubenfeld owns 51.92%. Both Luxembourgers.</p>
<p>(I'm looking to upload the supporting paperwork - standby).  </p>
<p>(EDIT GOES HERE:  https://imgur.com/i9lTtDc Verifiable at <a href="https://www.lbr.lu/">https://www.lbr.lu/</a> which is the Luxembourg Business Register. Put the above Business ID into the "RBE" which is the Beneficial Owners Registry.)</p>

<p>What's Norbet up to?</p>
<p>He has a Directorship at Lia Holdings Limited. (Very close to Liar, lol). with the following address - 52 LIME STREET, LEVEL 27, LONDON, EC3M 7AF</p>
<p>Fancy new building there for Norbet. What's on level 27, the registered address for Lia Holdings Limited?</p>

<p>Level 27 holds Lombard International</p>

<p>This looks more like a spicy meatball. We have a list of other directors in London that we can chase down, along with business names that contain the word CAYMAN in them. Niiiice.</p>
<p>So.... who is this rag tag bunch of professionals for Lia?</p>

<p>Oh look - Hi Norbet! He isn't a small fish either - used to be Global CFO for EY (one of the big four consulting and accounting firms in the world).</p>
<p>I see that they have their funds managed by Blackstone, a fairly large and spicy meatball in the U.S (I know this because they just tried to buy a Casino group in Australia).</p>
<p>I must say that many of the board on Lombard International Group are not small fish - international Chief Investment Officer of HSBC is a spicy meatball (Stuart Parkinson) or a senior figure of Blackstone's Tactical Operations Group in Qasim Abbas (sounds like a lame Bourne movie).</p>
<p>So what has this got to do with our situation?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/blackstone-and-citadel-have-reportedly-held-deal-talks-2019-10?r=US&amp;IR=T">https://www.businessinsider.com.au/blackstone-and-citadel-have-reportedly-held-deal-talks-2019-10?r=US&amp;IR=T</a></p>
<p><strong>Fuck. Off.</strong></p>
<p><strong>TL:DR - The strawman at Glacier, whom has a Residential Office but has a 48% owner in the former Global CFO of EY Norbet Raymond Becker, who sits on the Board and is Vice Chairman of Lombard International Group,  whose funds are managed by Blackstone, whom have been looking to merge with Citadel going back to 2019.</strong></p>
<p>Edit: Adding the screenshot for the Public Record of Beneficial Owners of Glacier Capital, which ties them to LIA, which ties them to Blackstone Tactical Operations, which ties to Citadel.<a href="https://imgur.com/i9lTtDc">https://imgur.com/i9lTtDc</a></p>
<p>Edit2: Do not confuse BlackRock (who are long on GME and are listed as an institutional investor in GME) to Blackstone, the company listed above. Have a read of this 2018 article. To help remember, Blackstone = BS = Wanted to merge with Citadel in 2019. https://www.economist.com/business/2018/01/13/blackrock-v-blackstone</p></content></body>
