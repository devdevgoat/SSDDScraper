<content><p>Hello fellow Apes,</p>
<p><strong>Obligatory Disclaimer: I am not a Financial Advisor, and this is not Financial Advice. Always do your own homework. That being said.. lets get started.</strong></p>
<p><strong>TL,DR:</strong> Hedies R FuQ. I used data from FTSE Russell's own Database 'Mergent Online' to calculate the current ownership numbers for GME... and my TITS ARE JACKED.</p>
<p>I found some very interesting ownership numbers for GME today. I am using Mergent Online as my data source, which is produced by FTSE Russell.. yes the same FTSE Russell that runs the Russell 2000 Index, which GME is <em>currently</em> a part of.  I have access to Mergent through the university I am currently at while finishing my bachelors in Finance in a few months.</p>
<p>Now before we get fully started on a simple ownership analysis.. I'm going to take us on a trip back to middle school math class and the dreaded topic of Algebra. Proportions and Cross Multiplying are a pretty simple topic and go something like this:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/mz00tbfuwy171.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b5901da8109b43c71e29b3807a9a5637e8fb716">Proportions and Cross Multiplication</a></p>
<p>For making Ownership calculations we need a base to go off of. Mergent Online (once again information reported by the index that GME is a part of)  reports the ownership of GME at the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/6io407b6yy171.jpg?width=3634&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea4aaabfb669429f115e1adb79cfdfbb65828caa">GME Ownership</a></p>
<p>Mergent Online has <strong>GME Shares Outstanding as 69,936,000</strong>. We need to keep in mind that this is a number reported <strong>as of 1/30/2021</strong>. Since then, GME has made a secondary offering of 3,500,000 shares. This gives us an <strong>Issuer-Stated Total Shares Outstanding of 73,436,000 or 73.436 Million shares.</strong></p>
<p>Now that we know how many shares there are <strong><em>supposed</em></strong> to be, lets check out the Insider Ownership.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/9haw4oug0z171.jpg?width=3622&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14a97865a44e6a912bf5246a906f1219fde92345">GME Insider Ownership</a></p>
<p>We can see that the Insider Ownership is broken into two distinct categories: <strong>Direct and Indirect Ownership</strong>. Direct Ownership is when the shares are listed <em>directly</em> in your name, and not say.. in shelter company like <strong>RC Ventures</strong>. We will do two different calculations in order to display the situation correctly.</p>
<p>Mergent lists the Direct Ownership at 8,057,864 shares totaling 11.52% ownership pie (we all like pies). This leaves 88.48% left over.. <strong><em>but  how many shares is that wrinkly brained ape?</em></strong> Lets put our trusty friend <strong>Algebra</strong> to the test.</p>
<p>(11.52/8,057,864) = (88.46/X)</p>
<p>11.52X=712,798,649.44   .. now to find X we divide each side by 11.52.</p>
<p>X=61,874,882.76</p>
<p>Now to check our math we add the 88.46% to the 11.52% to get a total ownership number.</p>
<p><strong>Previously stated ownership: 69,936,000</strong></p>
<p>8,057,864 + 61,874,882.76=  <strong>69,932,746.76</strong></p>
<p>To me.. being around 4,000 shares within the "Stated Shares Outstanding" checks out enough to me. To calculate the Free Float I added in the extra 3.5 million shares that were a part of the secondary offering <strong>(total shares outstanding 73,436,000)</strong></p>
<p>This would put GME at a <strong>Free Float of 65,378,136 shares.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BUT APE NO INCLUDE TENDIE MASTER!!</strong> I know, we are getting there.</p>
<p>*<strong>RC Ventures WAS NOT listed on the "Direct Ownership" list. The Indirect Ownership is stated at 15,760,670 shares.</strong></p>
<p>Adding the two 'Insider Ownerships' together gives us the following:</p>
<p>8,057,864 + 15,760,670 = <strong>23,818,534 for insider ownership</strong></p>
<p>This new number would give us a <strong>Free Float of 49,617,466 or 49 Million shares.</strong></p>
<p><em>Up until this point this is all stuff that we have basically already known.. its about to get a little more spicy.</em> Next we will cover the <strong>Institutional Ownership</strong> side. Now the Institutional numbers have always been wacky for GME, but I believe these next calculations provide insight into <strong>just how big of a hole hedgies have dug themselves.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GME Institutional Ownership- As Stated by Mergent FTSE Russell:</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/z3kg7s9q5z171.jpg?width=3647&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcd3b4b6e56200b41888ca0102fd80528de62b8e">Hedgies R FuQ</a></p>
<p><strong>Two things IMMEDIATELY stand out to me: #1 Institutions own 56,158,356 shares.... AT 28.87% ownership.. WHAT?!?</strong> This statistic is what is <strong><em>REPORTED</em></strong> to the index, these numbers definitely could be fudged.. but most likely to the downside and not the upside.</p>
<p><strong><em>So smart Ape.. if Institutions own 28.87% of GME with 56M shares.. how many shares does everyone else (aka Insiders and Retail) own at 71.13%?</em></strong> Once again, our friend Algebra comes into play.</p>
<p>(28.87/56,158,356) = (71.13/X)</p>
<p>28.87X = 3,994,543,862.28   (now we divide each side by 28.87)</p>
<p><strong>X= 138,363,140.36    or 138.36M shares.. GO APES!</strong></p>
<p>If we then subtract out the higher Insider Ownership number (Direct + Indirect) this gives us a <strong><em>Retail Control</em></strong> <strong>of 114,544,606.36 shares or 114 MILLION SHARES.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What the Fuq did hedgies get themselves into?!?</em></strong></p>
<p>Now according to the "Institutional Ownership" numbers I wanted to see around about how many <strong>Naked Shorts</strong> the firms had rehypothecated. To get the Total Shares Outstanding we would then add Institutional Ownership with Retail and Insider Ownership stats:</p>
<p>56,158,356 + 138,363,140 = <strong>194,521,496 shares.. 194 million fuqing shares.</strong></p>
<p>So with the institutional numbers and the Issuer stated numbers I came to the conclusion that:</p>
<p>194,521,496 - 73,436,000 = <strong>121,085,496 or 121 MILLION SHARES NAKED</strong></p>
<p><strong>What did Kenny get himself into.. well covering 121 MILLION shares he can't get his hands on because 114 MILLION are in the hands of Apes.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Please keep in mind these are the reported numbers.. they could truly be MUCH higher.</em></strong></p>
<p>I am always open to criticisms and questions/discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Be Excellent and Rock on Fellow Apes.</strong></p>

<p>EDIT 4 (5/29 afternoon): I am doing a more comprehensive review of ownership comparing the numbers reported by Mergent and FTSE Russell to those of: GameStop Proxy, Yahoo Finance Premium, FinteliO, Whale Wisdom, Koyfin, Fidelity Research, Nasdaq, CNNMoney, and MarketBeat (I think I named them all.. may be more I'll update as needed). I am trying to match numbers to see if I can find any discrepancies in data reported.  </p>
<p>I have also contacted Mergent &amp; FTSE Russell to try and see if I can get any information on <em>how</em> they source their information. On their website it states they have a <strong>dedicated data team that updates the data live daily from multiple market sources</strong>. I am not sure how true this is, but in the data columns it did say "as of 5/28/21". I will updated on any information about data sources that I receive. </p></content></body>
