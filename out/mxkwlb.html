<content><p>Hi everyone, hope your weekend is going well,</p>
<p>Just a gentle reminder of the short interest in our favourite stock.</p>
<p>This is not financial advice, and I am capable of being incorrect, so please call me out at any point so I can edit the post. A few pieces of info here are from previously verifiable DDs from our old subreddit that I can't seem to find, so I will link them as I continue to look for them. Please come to your own conclusions, and remember that we are each our own individual investor, with our only bond being our mutual liking of the stock.</p>
<p>We originally were speculating based on Darkpool share trading data that ~440million shares have been synthetically created and are being used to trade within darkpools. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7x2gq/dd_i_did_the_math_there_is_literally_no_doubt/">Estimates around these numbers have appeared in quite a few older DDs.</a></p>
<p>We used this information (based on the original count of ~50million shares available for public trading) to estimate that SI was over 900%.</p>
<p>THEN YESTERDAY: <a href="https://preview.redd.it/1pqbq8iuzsu61.jpg?width=354&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b76796d2033adadffdcaa149f25287e66f6e3ab">According to Gamestop's 14A, there is only 26.7 Million shares available for trading to the public, not including ETFs or institutions under 5% ownership.</a></p>
<p>Meaning that based on the pre-existing information of a 440 million share synthetic float, and the NEW information that the public float is supposed to be 26.7 million shares, the short interest is roughly double our original estimates, at ~1800%</p>
<p>And that was based on darkpool data gathered a MONTH ago!</p>
<p>APES HAVE BEEN BUYING THE ENTIRE TIME, AND HEDGIES HAVE NOT STOPPED MANUFACTURING SHARES.</p>
<p>THIS NUMBER IS ABSOLUTELY HIGHER NOW.</p>
<p><a href="https://media.tenor.com/images/c883d2b9b94e0af0ce8e03a57a5f2c0f/tenor.gif">You know how I feel.</a></p>
<p><strong>So lets have a talk about what this could mean for <em>you</em> and your tendies.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Retail owns the float. There is no doubt about it at this point. Not only has GameStop confirmed it, but DD that has been done for <em>months now</em> has come to the same conclusion, and those numbers get higher every single day they don't release the brake on the share price. We are a leviathan, and institutions are trapped in our orbit.</li>
<li>With 26.7 Million shares in the entire publically traded float, the estimates of a 1800% Short interest means that for every real share that exists on God's green Earth, <em>eighteen synthetic shares</em> had been manufactured that MUST be bought in order to close the short position. Emphasis on <strong>must be bought.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's do some guesstimate numbers:</p>
<p>Platform | Number of users
---|---
WSB | 9,918,741
GME |274,134
Superstonk | 226,190
General public| ????</p>
<p>I'm gonna put this bluntly - <em>I trust all of you.</em> Based on the last few months, the buying/selling action of the stock, and the overall sentiment of users within the GME-centric subs, there is a feeling of comradery and mutual trust between us all. The floor of $10,000,000 has been set in stone, and apes are NOT willing to budge. This is excellent, as it gives us all a target floor, and will almost guarantee that nobody sells below this number. I bring this up now, because this is one of two major ingredients needed to reach our goal - tendies. The second, of course, being <em>owning the float.</em></p>
<p>Based on the above numbers (and taking into account one person can be subscribed to multiple subs), based on the WSB numbers ALONE each person would need to own just under <strong>THREE SHARES.</strong> Let's be generous though, and say that half are only there to spectate on loss porn, bumping that number up to 6 shares per person. Now, I don't know what sort of magic 8ball Kenny G is basing his business decisions off of, but allowing people to <strong><em>share information over a long period of time whilst dropping the price in an unsuccessful attempt to shake paperhands</em></strong> just means that people buy more. And more. And more.</p>
<p>I have been watching the subs since January, and I can safely speculate (please tell me if you have a differing opinion and back it up) that each ape here, at least in this sub, owns on average around 10 shares. This is the average, every-day ape. However, over time this position has grown and grown, and I am seeing people state that they have XXXX shares. Hell, there have been ENTIRE THREADS about people announcing their STAGGERING amounts of shares. Of course this is a minority, but the GROWING MIDDLE CLASS OF APES now seem to own in the high-XX's to mid-XXXs. HOW CAN YOU TELL ME THAT WE DON'T OWN THE FLOAT. This isn't even including the everyman^tm investor that isn't affiliated with Reddit, and maybe bought the stock on a tip of their son/daughter/third cousin twice removed.</p>
<p>To tie this in with the first part, if we (as in our small part of the world here online) OWN THE FLOAT MULTIPLE TIMES OVER, and we have it drilled into our thick skulls that $10,000,000 is the FLOOR, then SUCCESS IS GUARANTEED. Who cares is Joe Everyman sells his four shares at $20K each. Who cares if Blackrock decides to sell their entire position at $8Mil. ITS A BUYING FRENZY, ALL SHORTS MUST COVER, AND WE OWN THE FLOAT.</p>
<p>You will get your tendies.</p>
<p>Hedgies r fuk.</p>
<p>Edit: I'd just like to throw this on the end in a response to the question "If no one is policing them then why would they stop?"</p>
<p>My <strong>guess</strong> is that initially, due to historic shorting strategies on companies and normal market movement, they thought that retail would eventually sell when the price tanks, so they doubled down on the shorts. However due to the Age of Information, retail quickly spread short-squeeze data between each other and held. Hedgies, not knowing what was happening (at this time they didn't know about WSB), doubled down again and again and again, <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Pewyx0yeAeZx43GFIUw2XKr2dH4lsyYOWgSb_BndAFIKQZ7z0dObiwmN3WyEoAy8SejiQN80pYauNqzdwkkDQABGx-a0iFvLe0PQ5evH1zbGzJs3PzPu2J_PnPA7ar31Uzcar9giSyABj4yM9eLFkS95IHn94I8plN_5yGD6F2r4">pushing their share-creating algorithms to 11</a>. Only in the last maybe month or so, when liquidity dried up, can we see that hedgies have abandoned that strategy and have gone full psy-ops on us. However, by this point too many shares already exist, and we have been gobbling them up every day.</p>
<p>It's that magical combination of giving us time to prepare, giving us an incredible pricepoint and the constant stream of good GME news that has got us this far. We have already won the lottery, now we are just determining the payout.</p></content></body>
