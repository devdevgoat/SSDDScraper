<content><h1>First of all, a note behind my thinking regarding sending my findings to the SEC and FINRA:</h1>
<p>Regarding: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mihbr1/i_have_contacted_the_sec_regarding_my_findings_of/">https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mihbr1/i_have_contacted_the_sec_regarding_my_findings_of/</a> if you missed it</p>
<p>There were many of these comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>'they're not gonna do anything'</li>
<li>'they're in bed with the hedgies'</li>
<li>'now they're gonna halt trading and screw the squeeze'</li>
</ul>
<p>and while some may be from shills (last one especially), the first two are not an unreasonable sentiment to have at this point. Whether I agree or not is irrelevant, but I'd like to explain why I did what I did and will continue to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not like they don't know what's going on. I don't think I'm the first person to find what I found, and it's not revelatory. This was about letting them know that we know, and that we're watching.</li>
<li>It's about removing plausible deniability. I will continue to track this activity and to report it. Once you remove plausible deniability, only complicity remains.</li>
<li>In theory, they do work for you, and to protect you. Given enough pressure exerted through media and your representatives, they cannot sit idle. They have to at least pretend to do something.</li>
<li>All it takes is one investigator with a hard-on. In every institution, no matter how corrupt, there are sticklers, there are professionals, and there are people who will put their life on the line for truth and integrity.</li>
<li>You are vastly underestimating your influence. On January 27th, did you think we'd be producing this level of research as a group? That'd we'd uncover huge schemes of corruption that have bled our world dry for decades? That we'd start uncovering it THE MOMENT WE DECIDED TO? None of us did. We are powerful far beyond our own understanding. The same goes for exerting pressure on those who should protect and serve you. You have no idea what can be done, because we haven't tried.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apathy towards institutions, the system, the establishment and democracy in general is understandable. One voice will be silenced. When thousands of people start pressuring their reps with concrete and coherent evidence, they cannot be ignored. Yes, the system is designed to give an illusion of working for you. But when you pressure it with such heat, they cannot admit it's not meant to work for you.</p>
<h1>But what about the 005 DTCC filing? Isn't it over? Moon this week?</h1>
<ul>
<li>The 005 looks good, but how many times have you gotten excited about something for the chart to go +0.5%?</li>
<li>It's not over until it's in effect and we start mooning. Until then, it means zilch.</li>
</ul>
<h1>'The Game Did Not Stop' Project</h1>
<ul>
<li>Many of you asked for a professionally packaged piece containing my research that could be presented to the media, government officials, etc.</li>
<li>Many of the you asked whether we could compile a summary of the most damning and evidence-driven DDs, as well as an outline for the whole story.</li>
<li>Many of you asked me to contact investigative journalists or writers to pick this up.</li>
<li>Someone wrote 'there must be someone here who writes for a living that can put this together'.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well...there is.</p>
<p>And I'd love to do it.</p>
<p>In fact, I have been making dozens of pages of notes and bookmarks to write a book about my own GME journey when this is done.</p>
<p>Somebody suggested a particular writer that does investigative books that would own this subject. That's great. But that's not going to be the same as someone who lived it. Writing that book will be my main post-moon focus whether it moons tomorrow or in a year.</p>
<p>For now, I know I could use my skills to package all that knowledge into a singular resource that dispels all the lies and manipulation, and sets out a data-driven theory of what's actually happening.A way to get the truth out of a 'Reddit echo chamber', and show the outside world, be it your relatives, your senator, the media, or Joe Biden - that this is not a cult, this is not a bunch of neckbeards thinking they're the protagonist in an anime, this is a community of professionals, long-time investors, and other reasonable adults from all walks of life that set out on a quest to find the truth when they've been screwed, and every institution in the world who's meant to protect them, abandoned them.</p>
<h1>Why I think this is the way</h1>
<p>We have excellent minds working in unison here. We all have a particular set of skills. We are all Liam Neesons. We are what the internet was meant to be - collaborative, supportive, trying to help everyone up instead of keeping them down. However, we are currently confined to somewhat of an echo chamber. That's not our fault, it's how the internet works right now.</p>
<p>This is why I believe that a comprehensive but easy to understand and compelling summary of the most damning and evidence-based DD must be created and distributed to everyone that is meant to protect and serve you, in government, in law enforcement, etc. It must be distributed to journalists and activists alike. If you want official petitions to get going, it needs this. If the rug gets pulled again, and you want to set up a class action - it needs this.</p>
<p>We have already shown that we are powerful and competent beyond our wildest estimation. We have rearranged our internal worlds to make space for this, to understand, to learn. We learned, we investigated, and we are onto them.</p>
<p>It's time to start affecting the external world. We could have a signed confession from Kenny G but it doesn't matter if it never gets outside of Reddit. We all have voices and connections. After my research went live, it turns out two of you live next door to FBI agents/directors(!), several of you work in the press, and someone even had an email I could use to reach John Oliver. It's incredible. We all have ways to affect the world in our own little way.</p>
<p>Right now however, our message is scattered. If it was comprehensive, coherent, and polished, it would be endlessly more difficult to dismiss and ridicule.</p>
<p>We are not crazy, we are not delusional, we are consistently reasonable, conservative, and collaboratively expanding our shared knowledge and understanding. We help each other, big apes explain to smaller apes, it's actually pretty incredible what goes on here. You all have a right to feel great about what happened here regardless of final outcome.</p>
<h1>About me - You decide whether you want to put the trust in me to do this work:</h1>
<ul>
<li>I hold a degree from the London School of Economics in a non-financial subject. As you may or may not know, that's a prime breeding ground for the City of London banks, corporate management, and future heads of state. I have rubbed shoulders with the slimiest of them, and I profoundly understand the callousness and arrogance of those who think they are entitled to the whole world. Luckily, while I was there, I also learned I am not any less capable than any of these MFs.</li>
<li>I made my living as a copywriter, marketing exec, and brand strategist for 7 and 8-figure companies. Every thing you can think that a company would create to promote themselves, I have done, as well as commanding these things on a macro level. I've been been the youngest person in a boardroom by a margin of 25 years, telling them the approach they used for the last decade is wrong, and convinced them.</li>
<li>I have project managed and edited the publication of 150+ pieces of long-copy content a month. I have had weeks where I wrote 120-150 thousand words of original content. I have ghostwritten for international-household-name publications. I have ghostwritten Master's theses without holding one myself. I have written and composed eBooks up to 120 pages in length.</li>
<li>Obsessive research is my fuel. My approach always was 'Writing is easy, you are paying me to understand your business.' I have developed a meticulous research method that allowed me to crunch and understand 7-figure companies in less than 1 week and construct whole new brands in 2.</li>
<li>When not scrambling to post data asap to you apes, I am a competent and captivating storyteller due to another activity that I'd rather not discuss as I might as well just doxx myself.</li>
<li>The best topping on a baked potato is bacon.</li>
</ul>
<h1>My situation: this is not a sob story, this is for full disclosure. This is my GME story and how I ended up here.</h1>
<ul>
<li>I live with a disorder that makes it hard to regulate emotions, especially stress. As a result, I suffered a minor breakdown and depressive episode after the January crash. I got FUDded. It worked for a little while. It wasn't about 'losing' money - it was about the fact that I've been taken for a fool. I was vaguely informed back then, at best, I admit. But I have never been fooled like this. I've never even believed or invested into a 'sure thing'. I gambled once for 5 minutes when I was 8 years old with Pokémon cards, lost, and I hated it. I am cynical and skeptical beyond measure, but from what I could see, GME was the surest of things. And yet, something else happened. Since then, I have set out on a personal quest to at least confirm that I made the right decision given the available data, and that there was fuckery here. I've never had a problem with admitting I am wrong or made a mistake. The problem here was, there was no credible data apart from the Marian Trench in the GME chart to suggest that this was a mistake. The FUD started becoming too intense and desperate to be credible. When I was 18, I bought watches at police and repo auctions, and would sell them on eBay. After a while, I flipped up so much, I put 50% of my capital into a Rolex. The first time I wound it, the catch for the spring snapped, and it unwound breaking all the fine cogs off the gears. Do you think somebody gave a crap? Do you think somebody told me: 'You better sell it before it gets more broken!'? None of these hedgecucks would give a damn about someone losing money if they just made some. I know exactly how much it costs to get an article written for one of those publications. They were incessant, and clearly had editor guided bias. It was not squoze, and it was not over.</li>
<li>The next few weeks were spent learning about GameStop, Ryan Cohen, and averaging down. I realized this guy was a massive stud, and I'm going to get tendies squeeze or not. At $45, it was just too good not to Yolo. I pulled every spare asset and liquidated it - I sold my car to average down. Yup. My office is 7 metres from my bed anyway. I am all-in. I am in position that I will be paid handsomely, squeeze or just RC transformation.</li>
<li>The same disorder manifests in the inability to focus on multiple things. I am able to focus on things that interest or I'm passionate about 19h/7. Once I get into it, I don't stop until it's done, it's solved, or I'm the best (if it's a competitive endeavour). I am not able to even attempt doing things that I've lost interest in, or things I'm being forced to do, or that I don't consider 'important' in some dimension. It causes me emotional and psychomatically-physical distress. My whole body fights against it if I'm not passionate about it.</li>
<li>Due to this whole journey, I have completely neglected my business, and lost, or gave up 90% of my clients. It is what it is. It was either endlessly breaking promises, or a clean break. Once I am in something, I am balls deep. I don't have the time, desire, or willpower to engage with anything else. I had to figure out if I made a mistake, and if I've been cheated, then how. That is my nature. With my skillset, it's not really a problem to get clients, so I am not stressed over this long-term.</li>
<li>However, I didn't plan to put myself out of work while following this rabbit hole and YOLOing my life's work to average down. I guess that came organically.</li>
<li>That is the situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason why I'm describing this is to give some perspective. Because I am fully aware that other apes here create god-tier DD while working their full-time jobs and staying in check. I am not able to do that. My conditions are a gift and a curse. Whatever I focus on, I kill. It's just if what I'm obsessing about isn't making me tendies in the short-term, I end up in hot water sometimes. For reference on hyper-focused I can be on the right things, the whole deep-ITM-call research and writeup took less than 8 non-stop-hours.</p>
<p>A lot of you asked me privately or publicly what I need to continue researching GME, whether they could help, or said that you will contribute if I need it, or would love to buy me a beer for the work I've already done. This is why I've decided I don't need to feel shame about asking you for help. In my storied career in researching and writing, you guys have been the single most appreciative and supportive 'client'. This is why I have tried to list every relevant competence and factor that I could without outright doxxing myself - I am treating it like any other job interview.</p>
<p>Right now, I would love nothing more than to keep working on the GME rabbit holes and start putting together a coherent, complete summation of this whole shebang. I have earned a lot of money for a lot of different companies, but I never felt that something I did was as important as this.</p>
<p>I don't want to do this to feel important. I don't want to do this to be the face, the leader, or anything of this movement. I don't want to be a dubious YouTube celebrity. I actually have zero desire to reveal my identity until LONG after this is over, and all legal, financial and security matters relating to newly acquired tendies have been settled. I want to do this because I know there are many of you there that went through the same torment of self-doubt, of feeling crazy, or stupid, or taken advantage of. And some of you that went through that are not as fortunate as me to have the skillset and experience to bounce back into comfortable life if somehow these fraudsters wriggle out of this quandary. </p>
<p>I want to do this because you have been kind enough to show me that my skillset and character can make an immeasurable difference to something that can change the world forever.</p>
<p>I just want to keep giving my all to this community, but while knowing my family doesn't have to worry about where the next rent is coming from while Daddy is looking at the numbers and charts on his PC until 6am every day. What I'm asking of you isn't really for myself, I can live another 3 months on McDonald's. It's for those who have been worrying about me.</p>
<p>The amount that you will see as the Kofi target represents my family's living expenses, as well as my expenses for tools, data, separate gear and security measures for the next 3 months. Just for perspective, the amount I arrived at is less than what 100 hours of my time would cost a client.</p>
<h1>What happens to the money if it moons before any real work is done?</h1>
<ul>
<li>I will 10x the money received and donate it to a mental health charity that I deem trustworthy pending some research.</li>
<li>I will immediately get to working on that book, and send everyone that contributed a box of 10 to give out to all the people that ridiculed your investment - Here, educate yourself on why I'm a millionaire and you're not.</li>
<li>In fact, I will send everyone that contributed a copy in any scenario!</li>
</ul>

<h1>Itemized Statement of Work, i.e. The Blueprint</h1>
<ul>
<li>Completion of the deep-ITM-call-anomaly thesis. Investigate, validate, and put into ELI5 terms the mechanism of what IS happening with the deep ITM calls. So far, I have shown there is undeniable fuckery afoot. If we are to press ahead with trying to publish in reputable publications and apply pressure to all possible LEO/regulators, I believe there is no room for error or misconstruing. I'd hate for someone's effort to go to nothing because they throw it out and discredit it due to a misconception or error. Luckily I have been contacted by some very smart Data Science apes that will be able to help get this right. I also want to take time to contact scholars and academic researchers for review.</li>
<li>The other side of the story - married puts, and hiding FTDs in puts  to form a coherent picture of both sides of options being used to reset FTDs</li>
<li>Polishing and publishing of an ELI5 document for the deep ITM calls and married puts to be picked up by investigative journalists, LEO, etc.</li>
<li>First, assemble an ELI5 intro to all the terms, from the definition of short-selling all the way to the complex to preface the whole document.</li>
<li>Working with mods and DD writers to assemble a chronological timeline of relevant evidence to form as complete a picture as possible.</li>
<li>Working with DD researchers to assemble all the relevant indicators that indicate manipulation and their explanations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possibly with more budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engage my close associate who is also invested in GME and is an indie filmmaker / director / editor to create a visual presentation of this document.</li>
