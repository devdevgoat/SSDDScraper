						April 9 update: This piece has been heavily edited from its original presentation. I&rsquo;ve had plenty of shit talk about this post. I get it. Some of y&rsquo;all think I&rsquo;m fucking r*tarded for even posting this. But NOT ALL APES HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE JANUARY. I&rsquo;m just trying to help in my limited capacity. And it seems to have helped thousands of apes get their affairs in order before liftoff, so I stand by this post.&hellip;

 Brokers preparation - i think everyone should take the time to understand the nuances and rules that the broker applies on trading. Some brokers may have some sneaky fine prints. So you should make sure that nothing can get in the way of you and your tendies.&hellip;

						TL;DR - I have prepared a case which strongly indicates that Citadel Securities, along with it&rsquo;s &ldquo;affiliates&rdquo; are committing securities fraud. On March 26th 2021, FINRA released a new citation against Citadel Securities for nearly 2 years worth of securities violations. The only reason Citadel HASN&rsquo;T been busted for fraud is because they hide behind the veil of &lsquo;unintentional&rsquo; behavior. However, this post illustrates how Citadel&rsquo;s actions flag ALL 3 corners of the fraud triangle- pressure, motivation, and opportunity.&hellip;

						HOLY MOLY! GME has highest close since 1/29! If you haven&rsquo;t seen yesterday&rsquo;s POST (wb), I recommend taking a look before getting into today&rsquo;s action, because BIG THINGS ARE HAPPENING! Congrats to the üíéüñêü¶ç that like movies, as without you, GME wouldn&rsquo;t be on the brink of launch. Prepare yourself, it&rsquo;s time for the tea. This is not financial advice, my üß† is smooth.

Up until 5/27, GME price movements were strongly correlated to AMC, making the year to date R^(2) value between the two 76%.&hellip;

						Hey guys pdwp90 here, founder of Quiver Quantitative (wb) for those of you who don&rsquo;t know me by Reddit tag.
This report is primarily comprised of &ldquo;alternative data&rdquo; which can be loosely thought of as data that comes from outside of traditional sources like earnings reports. The reason this type of data gets me so jacked is because it&rsquo;s data that retail investors (you guys) often have an edge over Wall Street in interpreting.&hellip;

						Some people are getting a little confused. These &ldquo;auctions&rdquo; are not for GME stonk or any other stock for that matter. These are for open options contracts in other companies that have yet to expire and will need to be sold to cover short positions. The OCC handles all options transactions while the NSCC handles securities (stocks) transactions.
This rule is set to drop tomorrow (April 6, 2021) on the federal register.&hellip;

						Hello Fellow Apes,
I am writing this post to let Apes know that I was able to follow-up through the SEC and the DTCC on SR-DTC-2021-005 and to the follow-up on work in my initial post here (wb), and providing you now with the status update I received.
I would also like to report that the SEC and the DTCC once again were very gracious and timely in their responses.&hellip;
