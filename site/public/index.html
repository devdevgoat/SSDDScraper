						TL;DR- The DTC has been taken over by big money. They transitioned from a manual to a computerized ledger system in the 80s, and it played a significant role in the 1987 market crash. In 2003, several issuers with the DTC wanted to remove their securities from the DTC&rsquo;s deposit account because the DTC&rsquo;s participants were naked short selling their securities. Turns out, they were right. The DTC and it&rsquo;s participants have created a market-sized naked short selling scheme.&hellip;

I wasn’t looking into GameStop when all of this began. Most of my time was spent researching the pandemic’s impact on the economy. I’m talking about the economic steam engine that employs people and puts food on their tables.&hellip;

						Labeling this DD because, aside from having to do with an offer to be paid to post DD, I actually performed due diligence on the offer (wb).
If you think those alarm posts yesterday about top posters here/YouTubers getting paid to distract apes during the MOASS was FUD, I&rsquo;m here with proof it&rsquo;s totally fucking true. (Details edited out for privacy. More on why below&hellip;) I have now sent unedited proof of the company to mods just for public integrity so you all know I&rsquo;m not making this up.&hellip;

						Hey everyone! It&rsquo;s Warden. I&rsquo;m taking a brief moment to write a chart analysis post because I feel that we are nearing a critical junction point. The volume today has been extremely low, currently sitting at around 1.7 million, and I feel that a lot of people are sensing that something big is coming. I&rsquo;ve emptied the rest of my bank account into the dip today to buy more tickets to the moon.&hellip;

						First of all, I’d like to start off by stating this post is completely nonpartisan. GME is not a political debate, it’s a class war.
Okay, let me ask you guys this — how many of you knew that when the pandemic began, the FED pumped $3 trillion dollars into the markets? I watch the news in the background all day, every day, and I didn’t know at the time when the injections were happening.&hellip;
