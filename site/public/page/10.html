						Everyone needs to read this:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/movevb/dance_of_darkness_the_sec_and_dark_pools/ (wb)
630 million share data confirmed by TD.
There is a tonne of great DD in this post. read it, then read it again, then understand it after reading it again.
PRO tip: on android device long hold over text, select all, select 3 dots on right, select &ldquo;read aloud&rdquo;
This helps me digest those extra long DDs
marked at possible DD to bring attention to the real DD linked&hellip;

						See the edits at the end if you want to follow a trail of DDs that leads us here.
This is just a theory. But we know that Citadel has been hiding FTDs in some kind of married put shenanigans, so maybe they have a way to use these shell companies to hide an even greater short position than we can even tell from their activity alone.
Look how Melvin hid their positions for two months by asking for a secret filing even when they knew they wouldn&rsquo;t get one.&hellip;

						Disclaimer: I am an ape who just learned how to form complete sentences. Please provide any counter evidence to the following theory.
There&rsquo;s a lot out there that the 49% loss on Melvin seems sus in regards to timing and the seemingly &ldquo;too good news&rdquo; especially with the way things have been going. Several OPs suggest that this could be a distraction or a setup for a fake squeeze soon. Both are entirely plausible and I am currently attempting to scour additional records to see if something was swept under the rug and not picked up by MSM.&hellip;

						*********** I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice ************
Salutations, apes.
Last night, as I was listening to Carly Rae Jepson&rsquo;s smash hit &ldquo;Azz &amp; Tittiez&rdquo; in my race care bed, a thought came to me: hedies r fuk. Then I woke up to my wife yelling at me to pay her boyfriend&rsquo;s rent. I immediately apologized to both of them and bought him flowers and chocolates so he knows that I care about him.&hellip;

						Dance of Darkness: The SEC and Dark Pools Hello everyone, as requested I am trying again to get this on r/Superstonk so this stays documented, and allows the light of transparency to be shone upon Darkpools, hopefully this time it uploads, and if it does, enjoy:
Hello everyone, thank you in advance for your patience and for reading this thesis on dark pools and the SEC. First, please note that this is strictly not financial advice and just research I have compiled over weeks for entertainment purposes—it&rsquo;s all-public information and not intended to affect the price action of any stock in any way, shape, or form.&hellip;

						TLDR - Options data show that the hedgefunds are still fucked and the original plan for bankrupting GME hasn&rsquo;t changed. Since I&rsquo;ve become more active on reddit either making posts, commenting more or responding to DMs I&rsquo;ve started getting threatening messages and &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; comments, these do not bother me and the tone of my posts will now include a lot more sarcasm and mocking in response, please enjoy.

						The purpose of this DD is to look at the outcome if there are many more votes cast at the shareholder meeting than GME shares that are issued and outstanding. I have a background in corporate and securities law, but this is not legal advice (for GME or for apes). Just a recording of one random apes research on a topic of this ape’s own interest.
The assumption for this DD is that there will be more votes cast or otherwise represented at the shareholder meeting than GME shares that are issued and outstanding.&hellip;
