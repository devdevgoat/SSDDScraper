The purpose of the proposed rule change is to enhance the Exchange’s Retail Price Improvement Program for the benefit of retail investors. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to make the following four changes: (i) revise the definition of Retail order in IEX Rule 11.&hellip;

						It recently occurred to me that in WSB, it’s against the rules to post about penny stocks, so not a lot of you follow the price action.
I&rsquo;m a day trader and my trading strategy focuses entirely on penny stocks that are owned by hedge funds known to manipulate the market. Most stocks I invest in are all complete garbage, but I look for pump and dumps, obvious manipulation patterns, and anticipate runners based on near-identical charts of multiple companies.&hellip;

HOLY SHIT! Dear Apes,
I decided to do some homework today. I know some of this is not new information but I contacted my broker and started asking questions. This was the part I found shocking&hellip;(I&rsquo;m removing the reps name so not to get them in trouble) and that I had no idea that I couldn&rsquo;t call back my shares or even have a vote in the proxies &hellip;.&hellip;

						(Originally posted Friday, reposting for visibility)
What’s up
FTSE Russell’s website has been crashing for the past 5 hours but I was finally able to get it to load. Today, FTSE Russell announced preliminary changes to some of their indexes.
Why is this important? Well previously, GameStop was in the Russell 2000, 2500, and Microcap indexes. You can see how companies are organized into these indexes here (wb) page 21.&hellip;

						Hello fellow Apes,
Obligatory Disclaimer: I am not a Financial Advisor, and this is not Financial Advice. Always do your own homework. That being said.. lets get started.
TL,DR: Hedies R FuQ. I used data from FTSE Russell&rsquo;s own Database &lsquo;Mergent Online&rsquo; to calculate the current ownership numbers for GME&hellip; and my TITS ARE JACKED.
I found some very interesting ownership numbers for GME today. I am using Mergent Online as my data source, which is produced by FTSE Russell.&hellip;

						Preface/Repost edit: Doubt everything, Do not trust this or any other post made by anyone as is without doing your own research. Do not think this is the whole picture, it&rsquo;s not. I am not a financial advisor and I could just be insane.
Since I saw u/atobitt referencing Cede and Co in his current DD I wanted to just put this back out into the world as this post never took off in r/GME or r/wallstreetbets (a couple hundred upvotes) like it did in r/stocks (5k+ upvotes + all the awards which is basically all my accounts karma) and I feel like the info could be useful for people who want a bit more background on Atobitts post.&hellip;

						This is not financial advice, obviously.
So I would like to start by saying that all of this is public information. I started from the company&rsquo;s Linkedin address posted in the message being sent to the redditors:
https://www.linkedin.com/company/lifewatermedia/ (wb)
The founder of the company is named Ty Hoffer (Tyson Clay Hoffer):
https://www.linkedin.com/in/ty-hoffer-079365b/ (wb)\
https://www.corporationwiki.com/Texas/Houston/tyson-clay-hoffer/36784041.aspx (wb)
It seems that this is not Ty&rsquo;s first rodeo, he was the President of a company called Winning Media LLC (there is no Linkedin page for this company, but I found the actual website):&hellip;
