						Hello there fellow apes. I have decided that with a new sub should come new DD and so I have decided to write this article. Now some of you may remember me from my last article where I talked about the suspicious amount of companies that went bankrupt under the rule of the ousted members who may or may not have been planted there in order to insure GMEs failure.&hellip;

						After this week and seeing the massive presence of members of the sub, I‚Äôve been keeping track of how many users are online. The peak of this was 197,000 but we‚Äôve been averaging about 150,000 for about two days straight. Today, the number has slowly declined to about 80,000 about 15 minutes ago. All of a sudden it dropped to 24,000 at 11:20PM. It‚Äôs safe to say that most likely 100,000 accounts here are either bots or old accounts used by shills to maintain an online presence.&hellip;

						Good morning Apes
Expect fuckery. This is a CRAZY week on the options side. The hedgies absolutely cannot lose control of the price this week, they will use every trick and cheat that exists this week.
I don‚Äôt think this is a week where anyone is worried about max pain. This is a week where hedgies just need the price as low as they can get it to avoid those call options going ITM.&hellip;

						TL/DR It&rsquo;s possible that Bank of America is holding the biggest bag in the Gamestop saga
Note: This is just a theory, and I am not advocating anyone to do anything with their BofA accounts. Just some information I found and felt an obligation to share. I am not a financial advisor.

 If you owe the bank $100 that&rsquo;s your problem. If you owe the bank $100 million billion, that&rsquo;s the bank&rsquo;s problem.&hellip;

						TL;DR - Hedge funds are manipulating penny stocks by exploiting the OTC market and using a pump and dump strategy to raise funds in their war against us.
 So I have strong evidence to suggest that hedgies are pumping &amp; dumping penny stocks to keep a constant inflow of cash to fight their war against us.
I came about this from skimming through the FINRA OTC data.
At first, I started to look at December data, because I wanted to see if hedge funds were trading penny stocks on inside information, by trading OTC the volume and price isn&rsquo;t affected on the charts and they can essentially trade behind the scenes.&hellip;

						Update 1st June 2021:
RIP to my inbox, however I managed to go through all messages and updated my table accordingly, main changes listed here:
-&gt; (New) T212 total shareholders available
-&gt; (Updated) eToro numbers. Apparently 96k GME investors (wb) on eToro !
-&gt; (Updated) Selfwealth (wb) total number of GME shareholder available.
I encourage all of you apes to go and ask your broker for data available. Shares per ape, total shares held, total shareholders, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&hellip;

						( Its important to recognize that this IS NOT a rule or regulation, it is a staff statement. Not saying nothing will come of this or it won&rsquo;t be acted on, but we can&rsquo;t take this to mean it&rsquo;s a rule that will be enforced.)
The letter is an internal letter, what you may understand is basically that its similar to a &ldquo;Disclaimer&rdquo; written at the bottom of internal memos, letters etc, stating that the letter in itself is not a new actionable regulation.&hellip;

Ok, this morning&rsquo;s first 15 minutes was a pretty good control sample, as it shows a big price push down, bouncing off $180, then passing it, then beginning the push down again:
   Time of Candle Trades on ATP Trades after Refresh Difference Percentage Reduced     9:31 62017 47494 14523 23.&hellip;

This is confirmation&hellip; that last prickling doubt telling you maybe it wont work?.. what happens if?
Well it will&hellip;and it is&hellip; and if your reading this your probably knee deep in shit and paddling like a toddler in a ball pool like the rest of us anyway.&hellip;
