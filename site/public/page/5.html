						Hey guys pdwp90 here, founder of Quiver Quantitative (wb) for those of you who don&rsquo;t know me by Reddit tag.
This report is primarily comprised of &ldquo;alternative data&rdquo; which can be loosely thought of as data that comes from outside of traditional sources like earnings reports. The reason this type of data gets me so jacked is because it&rsquo;s data that retail investors (you guys) often have an edge over Wall Street in interpreting.&hellip;

						Atobitt made some great DD. House of Cards 1-3. Everything Short. Classics. However, part 2 and 3 of HoC felt incomplete. No offense to the man, no offense to the data. I think it is spot on, i think we all know what to do. HODL.
But, I am here to add this, somewhat controversial, somewhat illuminating piece of information. I hesitate to post this because I don&rsquo;t want to insinuate there are other plays.&hellip;

My fellow apes,
I believe it was Sun Tzu who said &ldquo;If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.&rdquo; That is what we face every trading day, as the saga of GME continues.
I am keen to inform you further about the antagonist of this story (though I&rsquo;m sure as a likely narcissistic psychopath he doesn&rsquo;t see it that way).&hellip;

						Recently there has been a screenshot of a NYSE SRO filing being circulated purporting to show that NYSE is &ldquo;suspending a ton of dark pool groups.&rdquo; Or that NYSE is appealing an SEC ruling or something like that.
So to start, NYSE has nothing to do with dark pools. NYSE is a lit exchange regulated under the Exchange Act, while dark pools are &ldquo;Alternative Trading Systems&rdquo; regulated completely differently (a combination of the SEC and FINRA).&hellip;

						TL;DR:
DTCC / OCC / ICC etc. &amp; Wall St want key things in place before GME unwinds, and we&rsquo;re now looking at a list that&rsquo;s been mostly checked off. This rocket is just about cleared for launch.

Go / No-Go For Launch Opinion - Status: Hold ❌
We&rsquo;re on a scheduled hold. Preliminary system checks are good enough to launch, and now we are being held for atmospheric conditions to be just right.&hellip;

						Apes, lend me your ears.
I am pumped that GME took a fat dive from $268.80 down to below $235.00 as of this post. Why? Because it means we&rsquo;ve figured out the modus operandi of the shorts, and HFs are fuk.
TL;DR HODL, because GME is going to the moon. 🚀
T+35/T+21 Cycles This is real, and the juiciest part of this post. As I noted in my Cyclical Patterns in Failure-To-Deliver (FTD) and Short Interest Reporting (wb), written upon the DD of those before me, the T+35/T+21 cycles are consistent, empirical, measurable, and now, predictable.&hellip;

						Edit: RIParoni. I&rsquo;m currently rethinking this. You will notice that bursts almost always happen on wednesdays. I still believe there is a pattern and we should be able to pin down a date for another gamma burst.
I know, I know. Dates. Whatever. Stay with me for a moment please. (wb) I have high confidence that we are going to see a repeat of February 24th, and the MOASS will start tomorrow.&hellip;
