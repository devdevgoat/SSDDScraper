						Atobitt made some great DD. House of Cards 1-3. Everything Short. Classics. However, part 2 and 3 of HoC felt incomplete. No offense to the man, no offense to the data. I think it is spot on, i think we all know what to do. HODL.
But, I am here to add this, somewhat controversial, somewhat illuminating piece of information. I hesitate to post this because I don&rsquo;t want to insinuate there are other plays.&hellip;

My fellow apes,
I believe it was Sun Tzu who said &ldquo;If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.&rdquo; That is what we face every trading day, as the saga of GME continues.
I am keen to inform you further about the antagonist of this story (though I&rsquo;m sure as a likely narcissistic psychopath he doesn&rsquo;t see it that way).&hellip;

						Recently there has been a screenshot of a NYSE SRO filing being circulated purporting to show that NYSE is &ldquo;suspending a ton of dark pool groups.&rdquo; Or that NYSE is appealing an SEC ruling or something like that.
So to start, NYSE has nothing to do with dark pools. NYSE is a lit exchange regulated under the Exchange Act, while dark pools are &ldquo;Alternative Trading Systems&rdquo; regulated completely differently (a combination of the SEC and FINRA).&hellip;

						TL;DR:
DTCC / OCC / ICC etc. &amp; Wall St want key things in place before GME unwinds, and we&rsquo;re now looking at a list that&rsquo;s been mostly checked off. This rocket is just about cleared for launch.

We&rsquo;re on a scheduled hold. Preliminary system checks are good enough to launch, and now we are being held for atmospheric conditions to be just right.&hellip;

						Apes, lend me your ears.
I am pumped that GME took a fat dive from $268.80 down to below $235.00 as of this post. Why? Because it means we&rsquo;ve figured out the modus operandi of the shorts, and HFs are fuk.
TL;DR HODL, because GME is going to the moon. üöÄ
T+35/T+21 Cycles This is real, and the juiciest part of this post. As I noted in my Cyclical Patterns in Failure-To-Deliver (FTD) and Short Interest Reporting (wb), written upon the DD of those before me, the T+35/T+21 cycles are consistent, empirical, measurable, and now, predictable.&hellip;

						Edit: RIParoni. I&rsquo;m currently rethinking this. You will notice that bursts almost always happen on wednesdays. I still believe there is a pattern and we should be able to pin down a date for another gamma burst.
I know, I know. Dates. Whatever. Stay with me for a moment please. (wb) I have high confidence that we are going to see a repeat of February 24th, and the MOASS will start tomorrow.&hellip;

						Hey there, dildos and dildettes. I normally keep my DD to myself and my friends, but if I can convince my cautious anchor to reality that GME is going to the moon, maybe I can help you do the same.
If you don&rsquo;t have someone keeping you grounded and real, you should. Fiery passion only beats cold hard facts in Julie Garwood novels and succubus hentai.
OBV
OBV = On Balance Volume and typically it follows the price movement closer than Citadel interns follow this sub for the latest image of Kenneth as an alien covered in nipples.&hellip;

						A family member just sent me an article about Gamestop, and other &ldquo;meme&rdquo; stocks. Basically the article tries to spread FUD about investing in &ldquo;meme&rdquo; stocks, with Gamestop being the top of the list.
I read the article, but they provide no convincing arguments with regards to their title. What&rsquo;s interesting though, is that they have a chart showing how much money went into buying Gamestop from Korea. The figure is shown below:&hellip;
