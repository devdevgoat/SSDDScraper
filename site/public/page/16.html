					<time>Apr 28, 2021</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						Okay, I&rsquo;ve been typing all day and sipping coffee all night, so strap in for my crayon drawings.
Citadel and Point72 have owned at least 51% (controlling interest) in Melvin Capital since January 24th (through a private placement investment/unregistered offering) following Melvin receiving notice that their broker/dealer had margin called them. Let me explain.

Not that I think anyone should read or trust Reuters (or any source for that matter, even me) but they have been an interesting source to evaluate since January.&hellip;

						Holy Fuck.
This is probably one of the bigger things I have figured out so far.
I sifted through every Citadel Advisors LLC SEC Filing since the squeeze began (I have the spreadsheets to show it) and figured out some fucked up things (oh and I figured out who Suspecthanna is operating as - and they are doing the same thing as Shitadel).

						&quot; Once that CUSIP changes, the naked shorter has no apparent way to close out the naked short position. No stock under the old CUSIP number exists anymore; it all automatically converts to the new CUSIP. &quot; UPDATE AT BOTTOM: CUSIP CHANGE IS INCONCLUSIVE TO FORCE NAKEDS TO COVER. LOOKS LIKE WE NEED CRYPTO DIVIDEND FOR THIS STEP. EXPLANATION BELOW.

In [Shell Game I] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvvmvp/time_to_expose_the_shell_game_ftds_can_be_reset/) and Shell Game II(wb) you have seen that I am convinced other well-supported DD theories (such as deep-ITM Calls) do not come close to dealing with the full FTD problem that exists in the system. As I detailed in Shell Game II, ETFs containing GME featured extremely bizarre FTD data, much like our favorite stock, GME.&hellip;

After noticing the Crypto crash last night I got hit with a series of &ldquo;It was just a simple 10 BIllions margin call, happens all the time&rdquo; or &ldquo;China had a black out and erased billions of dollars&rdquo; or my favorite &ldquo;This is crypto, just zoom out&rdquo;.

There have been 4 other spikes downward in Bitcoin before this one and they&rsquo;ve all been this year after the huge run up that started in Dec 2020.&hellip;
