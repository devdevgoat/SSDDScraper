						What&rsquo;s up Apes
TLDR at the bottom.
I&rsquo;ve been sitting on my FOIA requests for about two months now, not wanting to make a post until I received an actual response. My request for a fee waiver was granted, so I didn&rsquo;t have to spend any $$$ better suited for more crayons to shove between my gorilla molars, but my request for an expedited process was denied. Apparently the financial risks to hundreds of thousands of Ape wallets doesn&rsquo;t constitute a national emergency, so I had to wait two more months before hearing anything back.&hellip;

Apes, I would like you to meet Motley Fool Asset Management https://www.mfamfunds.com/index.html (wb), the sister company of the Motley Fool.
This company has several funds and ETFs on their site. So I took a look at the top holdings for each one then did a search on motley fool for their articles to see if they are upholding their mission to help readers obtain financial information and discuss ways to make investment and personal financial decisions (wb) are just a propaganda machine to boost the stock prices of their holdings (spoiler alert: It&rsquo;s the propaganda one)&hellip;

This is 114 months from 4/14/21 there are so many data points you can&rsquo;t see it&rsquo;s absurd
So a beautiful autist wrote some code and put the data on tableau, it&rsquo;s the harvested FINRA FTD data for all tickers available.
Link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gmeshortsqueeze/viz/SECFails-to-DeliverData/SECFails-to-DeliverData (wb)
This is worth playing around with. But, when you do, you will come to the conclusion that this has been going on a long time, and has been predatory and systematic in nature.&hellip;

Below is a list of notable times they tried to FUD Apes out of their positions.

Remember this list.

						“Behind every great fortune there is a crime” – Balzac
This post is the collective narrative behind the plays on GME by large institutions. This will be a multi-part DD post gathered from excellent insights on this sub. As there have been no open confessions of these activities by the perpetrators (a la Bernie Madoff), or books that have yet been written, this will only exist as a theory with pieces of evidence to support where we can.&hellip;

						Straight from their website.
We aim to vote at 100% of meetings where our clients have given us authority to vote their shares, and therefore vote at approximately 16,000 shareholder meetings in approximately 85 markets each year. With regards to non-U.S. holdings, generally we estimate that we vote successfully at approximately 90% of meetings. Of the remaining, 8% are not voted due to shareblocking and 2% are not voted due to either the fund’s leverage, impediments such as ballots received post cut-off date or post meeting date, or other restrictions like in-person attendance or power of attorney being required in order to vote.&hellip;

						47%, Gary Gensler, Antitrust, and Citadel Gary Gensler talked about a lot of stuff at the hearing earlier this week. The representatives generally focused on a lot of garbage, and they have justifiably taken a lot of shit from this community for their piss poor understanding of the things they are supposed to oversee. Lost in the gamification discussion was Gary Gensler talking about market concentration and Citadel how 47% of all retail order flow is routed through Citadel.&hellip;

						APES. It has been a very good week. Don&rsquo;t let anyone try to tell you otherwise. Barely a week ago we were fighting for $180, now we have rock solid support at $245-250. It is all spelled out in black and white (green and red?) on the month-long chart: we are winning this battle.
I don&rsquo;t know about you but it has been quite a journey to get this far. Lots of twists and turns and emotions.&hellip;
