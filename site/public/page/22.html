						Not a financial advisor. Not financial advice
Greetings, Apes. Today I was contemplating whether to cut my hair into a mohawk or to get a bald fade. Obviously, those are very similar. Today, I decided to listen to Linkin Park&rsquo;s smash hit, &ldquo;WAP,&rdquo; which always gets me going. I was definitely feeling a little high cuz I had just consumed THREE, yes THREE, fig newtons when I got a message from another primate.&hellip;

						Part 1 ‚Äì Anatomy of a Short Squeeze
Pick the first thing you can think off ‚Äì let‚Äôs say, bananas. Then think of any characteristic of that banana, lets say ‚Äúsize of bananas‚Äù. I can assure you that, if you plot into a graph the size of every banana in the world, you would get a Gauss (normal) Distribution for that characteristic.
‚ÄúŒº‚Äù (mu) is the middle point, which is the most common size for bananas.&hellip;

If you or your parents have their retirement accounts PASSIVELY MANAGED BY BIG BANKS OR INSTITUTIONS, as opposed to actively-manages funds or having independent financial advisors, PLEASE LISTEN.&hellip;

						Alright apes and apettes. Like the rest of you, I am jacked to the TITS after seeing the recent Gamestop 14A filing (wb). I wanted to see what the remaining float was and if retail ownership really could be over 100%. So what&rsquo;s the remaining float after insider and institutional ownership?
‚Äã
Outstanding Float
As per the 14A filing, there are 70,771,778 Gamestop shares outstanding. Institutional Ownership (minus Ryan Cohen&rsquo;s LLC) comes out to 32,433,338 .&hellip;

						I know that collectively, we are anti-conspiracy right now, but as a simple ape, I just liked the way it rhymed.
What I&rsquo;m presenting is 100% based on the publicly available published FINRA OTC data. The way FINRA presents their data makes it really difficult to spot anomalies and trends, so I decided to compile it into an Excel spreadsheet. The trends are clear. The data is revealing. And the Hedgies have some serious wedgies.&hellip;

						Tick tock. Tick tock.
Yesterday, we reviewed volume data on GME for every day since mid-January (wb) in part one (of an undetermined number of posts). In that post, the data showed a trend of declining volume since the first squeeze and made a case for the increasing risk of slippage and volatility.
Given the short hedge funds have made volume drier than the steak my wife&rsquo;s boyfriend&rsquo;s made tonight, it&rsquo;s becoming important to look for other indicators of the trend in this story.&hellip;

						This is it. Game ends. I win.
Let me preface: I have been trying to crack this code for 3 days now. And after the Bill Gates divorce, I got on the right track all because of his relationship with Buffet. But it was always just out of reach of the right ideas. Without further ado. Thank you to all the apes who kept asking questions, kept making me question it in the comments.&hellip;
