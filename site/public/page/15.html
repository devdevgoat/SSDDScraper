						Blanderson Snooper here, back with another page of toilet reading for all you Apes. Does an Ape shit in the woods? Only if there&rsquo;s wifi.
If you want a shot of feel-good confirmation bias, skip to the last section, &ldquo;The Good News.&rdquo; See you back here in a minute. If you&rsquo;re ready to take the whole wild ride, buckle up and enjoy.

Four weeks ago I published the Wargame Theory (wb), a cultural DD that used narrative as a way to explain some of the unexplainable parts of the GME saga.&hellip;

						So, we all knew today was going to be a battle for the $180 point because of the options expiry on this date. Lo and behold, right before we got to the $180 marker at 1:30, we got pushed down pretty intensely.
Now, we had seen a few weeks back a bunch of negative trades at settlement in after hours at 4:15, and then suddenly that stopped. But when the trade volume was exceptionally low, we kept seeing trades disappearing from minute to minute.&hellip;

						Dear Apes
I am watching a documentary on Amazon Prime called &ldquo;The Inside Job&rdquo;. I have not finished watching it, I just stopped it to run over to my laptop and check something.
In that documentary, the reason banks were able to do all sorts of wacky bullshit - First selling collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which were all the bad mortgages packaged into a high quality McHappy Meal, then later betting against CDOs - was because of essentially bribing regulatory bodies to give them a high rating.&hellip;

He says it is never glowing this late. He thought it was strange even before i called him!
I found the hotel using Google Maps cuz i went on a hunt for an ape friendly eye-witness confirmation that could confirm whether this is typical. ‚ÄúThis is STRANGE!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe building never glows this late. It is glowing.‚Äù He was a foreigner. These were his words.&hellip;

						*******Edit 3: last edit, my post you‚Äôll see I added incorrectly with tomorrow‚Äôs date NOT being T+21, that would be Friday 4/23! My initial post I had the 3rd squeeze date as 3/24 by mistake, therefore my day prediction is 1 day off. 4/23 would be the next FTD squeeze! ****** I AM THINKING 4/23 WE SEE SOME GREEN DILDOS
*****Edit 3.1: haha damn okay, I‚Äôm seeing a lot of 4/26 being the 21st trading day after&hellip;so in my smooth brain I included the day of the run up in the calculation!&hellip;
