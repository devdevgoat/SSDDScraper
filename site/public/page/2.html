						April 9 update: This piece has been heavily edited from its original presentation. I&rsquo;ve had plenty of shit talk about this post. I get it. Some of y&rsquo;all think I&rsquo;m fucking r*tarded for even posting this. But NOT ALL APES HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE JANUARY. I&rsquo;m just trying to help in my limited capacity. And it seems to have helped thousands of apes get their affairs in order before liftoff, so I stand by this post.&hellip;

 Brokers preparation - i think everyone should take the time to understand the nuances and rules that the broker applies on trading. Some brokers may have some sneaky fine prints. So you should make sure that nothing can get in the way of you and your tendies.&hellip;

Actual TL;DR: June 1st has kicked off with the DTC, ICC, OCC auction and wind-down plans officially being in place.&hellip;

						Edit: I made a new post describing how I trained the binary classifier (AI) used in this post (wb).
This could be it. This could be the whole scam.
TLDR: HODL. Simple as that. HODL and the shorts have no way to escape. They just writhe around in desperation as FTDs escalate, their options expire and New DTCC rulings approach. To support this belief I:
 Built an AI to detect Deep ITM calls used to create naked shares.&hellip;

						Updated version - https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nletnn/gme_the_mother_of_all_short_squeezes_moass_thesis/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
Intro: This post will give a relatively simplistic breakdown of the current situation and landscape of GameStop Stock, or GME (its name on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE), and to summarize the theory that it will soon reach astronomical levels during a market event known as a Short Squeeze. For specifically, this theory is the MOASS (Mother of All Short Squeezes) Thesis.
The core intention of the post is to summarize the MOASS Thesis for investors who are not fully up to speed on it, as well as those who are newer to the stock market in general, and are interested in investing.&hellip;

Introduction (DD starts below) Apes, did you know that there are usually about 80 confirmed cases of deadly shark attacks per year. You know what nobody ever talks about though? The fact that sharks have TWO, count it TWO, FUCKING PENSIS. I am not making that up. Imagine what I could do with two penises. I&rsquo;d have twice the total dick length.&hellip;

						The shitshow this morning is arguably the result of forum sliding, so let&rsquo;s counter that by collating some of the better stuff until the mods can clean up the front page. Here&rsquo;s what I found buried that is probably of interest.
 u/broccaaa has posted a follow-up to his earlier post about trying to detect hidden FTDs with machine learning. It outlines the method behind his data labeling and the AI architecture.&hellip;

In the linked in profile, they are advertising for one position in China with email domains for glacierchina.com (wb)
Running the advertisement through Google Translate, we can see that they have a public WeChat account: GlacierCap.

Probably no need for any more DDs from me after this one - its a cumulation of my thoughts over the past few months. People were interested in an SI% estimate so I thought, hell yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting shit. Why not?
On a side note, I&rsquo;ve learned pretty much everything I have about the stock market from Peppa Pig.&hellip;
