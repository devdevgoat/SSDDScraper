						TL;DR - I have prepared a case which strongly indicates that Citadel Securities, along with it&rsquo;s &ldquo;affiliates&rdquo; are committing securities fraud. On March 26th 2021, FINRA released a new citation against Citadel Securities for nearly 2 years worth of securities violations. The only reason Citadel HASN&rsquo;T been busted for fraud is because they hide behind the veil of &lsquo;unintentional&rsquo; behavior. However, this post illustrates how Citadel&rsquo;s actions flag ALL 3 corners of the fraud triangle- pressure, motivation, and opportunity.&hellip;

&ldquo;A tombstone is a written advertisement that gives investors basic details about an upcoming public offering.&rdquo;
EDIT #1 THANKS FOR ALL THE UPVOTES! I didn&rsquo;t expect this to blowup as I was just reposting it in light of the tweet. This is my theory based on facts. Also a great timeline of rc involvement with GME. Gamestop future is very bright in the near term and future. Not financial advice.&hellip;

						Black rock on CNBC ringing the alarm- too much liquidity in the market. ‚ÄúFEELS FROTHY.‚Äù
Link below, just watched live.CNBC usually uploads these vids to YouTube later.
Edit: From google- ‚ÄúToo much liquidity risks the creation of asset bubbles, like in housing before the financial crisis and farm land afterwards, and distorts financial markets. Throughout the world, ongoing central bank liquidity has bolstered financial assets rather than goods and services that produce growth in the real economy.&hellip;

						I have been taking some looks at the Level 2 information and it seems that when &ldquo;they&rdquo; want to drop the price, &ldquo;they&rdquo; use smaller lots of bids and asks - today was lots of 11 - 11 shares were being traded back and forth the entire time we saw a drop in the price down by $10. Other apes have noticed this before. See image 1.
I then noticed they stopped trading in these lots, see image 2 below.&hellip;

						üöÄ Time to expose the shell game. The Shell Game
FTDs are not ‚Äúreset‚Äù. FTDs on ETFs help show the short positions on the underlying securities. Edit: Each Shell Game post is intended to be read sequentially. You&rsquo;ve been misinformed on FTDs. You&rsquo;ll feel great after you go through this journey with me.
 Shell Game II (wb) Shell Game III (wb)  Many talented DD writers have theorized that FTDs are being reset using deep ITM call options and although it appears to be a credible theory that no doubt applies to many stocks, the singular attention it receives may have clouded our vision.&hellip;

						HOLY MOLY! GME has highest close since 1/29! If you haven&rsquo;t seen yesterday&rsquo;s POST (wb), I recommend taking a look before getting into today&rsquo;s action, because BIG THINGS ARE HAPPENING! Congrats to the üíéüñêü¶ç that like movies, as without you, GME wouldn&rsquo;t be on the brink of launch. Prepare yourself, it&rsquo;s time for the tea. This is not financial advice, my üß† is smooth.

Up until 5/27, GME price movements were strongly correlated to AMC, making the year to date R^(2) value between the two 76%.&hellip;
