						Edit: Grammar and thank you for the awards! Credit goes to all the apes who are helping to slide the pieces together and doing legwork. There is so much complexity to all this by fucking design and without the sheer number of people who are working tirelessly daily, none of this may have come to light and retail would keep getting bent over.
Borrowing from u/ForgottenBob, this should help for a summary or TL:DR.&hellip;

						************ I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice ************
Intro bahhhhhhhhhhhhh bahhhhhhhhhhhh bahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Woah apes, did you hear that? Oh no&hellip;. it&rsquo;s&hellip;.. it&rsquo;s our greatest weapon&hellip;. the computer apes&hellip;.. the geniuses&hellip;. THEY&rsquo;RE HERE&hellip;&hellip;.
Alright apes, this is gonna be a strange post. So as many of you know, I recently sent out a request for coders/big brain apes for a DD that I plan to make. I am not joking when I say that I have received well over 350 messages (a testament to how many extremely intelligent apes that are in this sub).&hellip;

						TL;DR
Investment companies are filing for amendments to combine the liability of holdings not registered with the SEC investment companies and they&rsquo;re buying government bonds through Principal Funds and filing those, while changing the language in their contacts regarding using those funds to up their liability insurance and assumedly collateral, or at best stability.
A number of these bonds have a value in the trillions.
Okay here we go
I&rsquo;ve spent the entire weekend pouring through SEC filings, and they tell a slow but compelling story that&rsquo;s been unfolding.&hellip;

						Hello all! Sorry to beat the drum about this but I feel like it should be summed up one last time as I&rsquo;m a stickler for accurate data and I have confirmation on some of the numbers that have been floating around the sub yesterday with regards to eToro.
Short version (TL;DR): I have confirmed by combing through the eToro APIs that there are exactly 96,660 GME holders on the eToro platform.&hellip;

In the US we never saw this ad but in Europe it was all over. How do I know? I live in Europe now.
I showed it to my gf and she said ‚Äúah I know that bear, that‚Äôs from T2‚Äù
I said what do you mean T2 and she said yea it‚Äôs from a movie called T2. So i asked her why she called it that and she said she never saw the movie but that it was advertised as T2 in this ad where he is shaking a martini and turns around.&hellip;

Welcome to The Chicago Code: Shitadel, a shitty crime drama television series created by Ken Griffin that aired on Reddit on the 18th of May.
Not financial adv&hellip;yada yada bing bong. I am not from the US, so try to sue me for anything. I&rsquo;ll wear a tinfoil hat and defend myself. Just an FYI: I&rsquo;ll refer to &lsquo;shorting&rsquo; when I am talking about a superior put position. Given the past of the stock and the option anomalies, as well as typical SHF behavior, it is highly likely that superior put positions indicate a short position to drive the price down.&hellip;

						So I just finished watching The Wall Street Conspiracy and I decided I wanted to dig a bit deeper to understand how naked short selling works. I highly suggest you watch the documentary as I found it really helpful to understand how hedge funds attack companies to achieve the Bankruptcy Jackpot.

While digging around I found this article from 2008 (I know it&rsquo;s a bit out of date) and it blew me away.&hellip;
