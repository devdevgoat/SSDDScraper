I would just like to firstly say this is just theory, don&rsquo;t listen to anything I say as i&rsquo;m a smooth brain.
So if you didn&rsquo;t see yesterday JP Morgan&rsquo;s net profit soars 5-fold to $14.3 billion (wb). I find this to be a little unlikely to be honest. We are on the the biggest bull run this market has ever seen, and the money printers keep on running.&hellip;

						Pre-DD Message: Hello you beautiful apes! Before I get into this DD I just wanted to say that I am so proud of everyone for holding against these wall street crooks. We&rsquo;re finally starting to see some change happen and more and more people are starting to catch on to how fucked of a position the hedgies are really in right now, and it genuinely makes me happy that we&rsquo;ve come from just some stupid retail investors looking for a quick buck to an educated mastermind of apes who scour the sub for DD and knowledge.&hellip;

						Edit - 04/11/2021 - The Fake Squeeze theory - Daily FUD Report (wb) - I&rsquo;ve decided to go in depth a little more on the fake squeeze theory in &lsquo;tomorrows&rsquo; FUD report.
​
EDIT (AGAIN) - For everyone saying that &lsquo;it might just be true&rsquo;, think about the most glaringly obvious problem.
They used Bloomberg and Reuters previously to push the &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve covered&rsquo; narrative (via anonymous source) back in February.&hellip;

Edit: forgot to mention that the exact same thing seems to be happening with AMC, which further makes me believe that this is orchestrated!
Introduction Apes, I&rsquo;ve relapsed. Yup, I did it. I stayed away from it for so long, but I just couldn&rsquo;t kick the urge. Yes, I am doing another technical analysis on GME. I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m an addict.&hellip;

						Edit/Update: Thank you for the love and awards!!! I have posted a question about this to Dr. Timbrath’s AMA, here (wb), if anyone else is interested on her opinion of this.
Apes, our primate community has gone through a lot in the last 4 months. We’ve been called names, lied to, and manipulated through the same PsyOps techniques typically used on extremist groups. Throughout everything you beautiful people have remained stubborn and hyper-rational while never losing your love of crayons, and I have never been more proud to be an ape.&hellip;
