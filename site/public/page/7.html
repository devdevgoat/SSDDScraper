						CREDIT TO u/FATJUUL FOR STRUCTURE AND INFO
MAY 7th Edit: They have postponed the ruling until June 21st, please see my followup post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n6zgng/nsc002_delayed_for_longer_period_of_comment_and/
I haven&rsquo;t seen as much talk about this, yet it is the biggest news to come and IT IS the endgame catalyst.
NSCC-801 Passed with no objections yesterday. For this rule to enter effect it needs to piggyback on NSCC-002, which if no objections are made again, will be passed this Friday.&hellip;

						Hi all, Blanderson here, back this time with all the DD you wanted in a story you didn&rsquo;t ask for.
Here are 100+ DDs that have shaped the GME saga.
This is the story of you, Apes, and the DD writers who have held us together and made us proud. As always, I hope you will enjoy.
I polled the Daily Chat about the name of this post and wanted to shout out some of the top alternatives.&hellip;

						Some people are getting a little confused. These &ldquo;auctions&rdquo; are not for GME stonk or any other stock for that matter. These are for open options contracts in other companies that have yet to expire and will need to be sold to cover short positions. The OCC handles all options transactions while the NSCC handles securities (stocks) transactions.
This rule is set to drop tomorrow (April 6, 2021) on the federal register.&hellip;

I would just like to firstly say this is just theory, don&rsquo;t listen to anything I say as i&rsquo;m a smooth brain.
So if you didn&rsquo;t see yesterday JP Morgan&rsquo;s net profit soars 5-fold to $14.3 billion (wb). I find this to be a little unlikely to be honest. We are on the the biggest bull run this market has ever seen, and the money printers keep on running.&hellip;

						Pre-DD Message: Hello you beautiful apes! Before I get into this DD I just wanted to say that I am so proud of everyone for holding against these wall street crooks. We&rsquo;re finally starting to see some change happen and more and more people are starting to catch on to how fucked of a position the hedgies are really in right now, and it genuinely makes me happy that we&rsquo;ve come from just some stupid retail investors looking for a quick buck to an educated mastermind of apes who scour the sub for DD and knowledge.&hellip;

						Edit - 04/11/2021 - The Fake Squeeze theory - Daily FUD Report (wb) - I&rsquo;ve decided to go in depth a little more on the fake squeeze theory in &lsquo;tomorrows&rsquo; FUD report.
​
EDIT (AGAIN) - For everyone saying that &lsquo;it might just be true&rsquo;, think about the most glaringly obvious problem.
They used Bloomberg and Reuters previously to push the &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve covered&rsquo; narrative (via anonymous source) back in February.&hellip;

Edit: forgot to mention that the exact same thing seems to be happening with AMC, which further makes me believe that this is orchestrated!
Introduction Apes, I&rsquo;ve relapsed. Yup, I did it. I stayed away from it for so long, but I just couldn&rsquo;t kick the urge. Yes, I am doing another technical analysis on GME. I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m an addict.&hellip;

						Edit/Update: Thank you for the love and awards!!! I have posted a question about this to Dr. Timbrath’s AMA, here (wb), if anyone else is interested on her opinion of this.
Apes, our primate community has gone through a lot in the last 4 months. We’ve been called names, lied to, and manipulated through the same PsyOps techniques typically used on extremist groups. Throughout everything you beautiful people have remained stubborn and hyper-rational while never losing your love of crayons, and I have never been more proud to be an ape.&hellip;
