						NOT. FINANCIAL. ADVICE.
(Re-posting this again. I previously posted it at an ungodly hour for most Apes, so was requested to share again.)
I have seen quite a few posts recently about The Motley Fool&rsquo;s business model, and decided to look a little more under the hood. From what I can see, they may have quite a direct connection with Citadel, and potentially enjoy a symbiotic relationship with them (through an important middleman).&hellip;

Apety apety apes. What&rsquo;s the difference between GME and my wife? GME doesn&rsquo;t fuck the mailman. Though my wife is a legal midget, GME is still wayyyyyyyyyyy more shorted than she is. Alright, enough about me. As always, remember to see my previous posts about the FTD cycle theory or you will be more confused than I am when my wife ISNT cheating on me.&hellip;

						I keep seeing posts like this one (wb) saying that &lsquo;they&rsquo; used dates to bring us down back in March. Or posts talking about shills and FUD and heavier moderation for MOASS like this one (wb) or this one (wb).
The simple truth of the matter is that we have tons of misinformation and confirmation bias floating around and we&rsquo;re just FUDding ourselves. The perfect example is the dividend nonsense which flew around the sub like a whirlwind before people finally found the good DD (wb).&hellip;

						Salutations once again my fellow apes. u/possibly6 back with some juicy confirmation bias solely using technical analysis.
As always, this aint no mothafuckin financial advice, hoe. The views expressed here are solely my approach to investing in this specific equity. I ape an am.
obligatory.
‚Äã
Let&rsquo;s get right down to business. I have reason to believe the price action we are seeing is nearly identical to January right before we ran ago 500+.&hellip;

						Edit#6 if you can read this before commenting. This has fucking nothing to do with Jordan beyond proving his bullshit move on from gme dead wrong
Before I cover this topic I need to first mention two things number one not financial advice two one of the major plot points I use has been slightly covered but I plan to dive into different correlations between this plot point and how it actually ties to the market.&hellip;

						EDIT 3: THIS SHOULD BE TAKEN AS GOOD NEWS!!!
The initial concern was that GameStop sold a bunch of bonds that have the option to convert into shares of common stock.
‚Äã
This means an owner of GameStop&rsquo;s bond can convert (under certain circumstances) into shares of GME to cover a large short position, without being traded on the market.
‚Äã
I have been informed by a few people that they do not have a currently have CONVERTIBLE BONDS&hellip;

						Hello, fellow apes!
Gherkinit here with another look forward at upcoming technical events, market fuckery, and some spectrum colored crayons.
This week I want to go over upcoming technical indicators and take a look at some things I&rsquo;ve noticed happening over this last week, such as, disappearing volume, lying little boys from Bulgaria, and the apparent effects of inflationary naked short selling.
As always later tonight I will post a consolidated Video DD of this on my YouTube (wb) for those of you that don&rsquo;t have the time to read through this.&hellip;

Preface ==========  Not a financial advisor. I also have no financial experience or qualifications. Thought I&rsquo;d make that clear per a commenter on my last post who wasn&rsquo;t happy with me. ;)
Also apologies if some of this doesn&rsquo;t read right. A bit buzzed typing it up lmao. I&rsquo;d be happy to clarify anything in the comments.
Hello apes. You might remember my previous posts. But just in case, I&rsquo;ll add them here once more because I&rsquo;d like to expand on them a bit further.&hellip;

					<time>Apr 10, 2021</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						It just occurred to me&hellip;
They&rsquo;re not reporting 49% loss on the short position itself.
Because like they say you dont lose til you sell. And if they covered, they&rsquo;d have lost a lot more. The number 49% makes no sense to me as a short position loss the more I think about it. Because it would bankrupt them. They&rsquo;d be -1000% not -49%
This occurred to me battling shills. So thank you shills.&hellip;
