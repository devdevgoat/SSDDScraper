I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. What the hell is a netting account and why does this matter?
​
WELL.
​
My wonderful apes let me feed you with some information. As always, I know nothing and may be putting 2+2 together to make banana. Please critique and help me fill in the gaps, my knowledge on this started approximately 10 minutes ago.

						^(Sit the fuck down before you read this.)
MY THEORY: u/Leenixus was almost certainly correct in Thinking that &ldquo;They&rdquo; got margin called today (wb).
In After Hours 1M shares seemed to &ldquo;disappear&rdquo; from EOD Volume before &ldquo;reappearing&rdquo; in the EOD Volume later before AH close. I BELIEVE this is because Citadel got margin called @ 1127 today and therefor those 1M shares traded had to be re-routed or re-done or what have you.&hellip;

						Update =========  Edit: Ah here we are after cinco de buyo. No big price move was made. That&rsquo;s some good shit if you ask me. The prediction was that we&rsquo;d see a price surge again if they delayed FTDs once more. The fact that it didn&rsquo;t happen today - no Deep ITM CALLs or PUTs occurred today - is reason to believe this is almost over. If Net Capital theory is correct, there&rsquo;s two possibilities here:&hellip;

						************ I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice ************
Apes, I&rsquo;ve recently gotten into comedy and wanted to test out some of my jokes on you:
Why did the chicken cross the road? Because my wife is fucking the mailman.
What&rsquo;s the difference between GME and my wife? GME doesn&rsquo;t have four boyfriends.
How many HFs does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Seriously guys my wife is a cheating whore.&hellip;

						TL;DR: GameStop is allowed to pay dividends as soon as it deposits the funds for their note buyback - which it can do at any point after the filing of the redemption notice and before the redemption date. If they have already deposited the funds, they can declare a dividend.
​
I have been looking at the indenture filing related to the 2023 debts GameStop announced they are paying out on the 30th of this month.&hellip;

						The final picture is starting to come together. The ties of the former CFTC (who now works for citadel) &amp; SEC chairmen to the industry appear to be pointing to fraudulent activity in efforts to prolong the necessity of SOFR being implemented. SOFR the last time it was attempted to transitioned into (in 2019) almost IMPLODED the market due to many realizing that banks and others could not handle a higher interest rate (based off the DAILY TRESURY YIELD RATE (wb)) versus the fabricated one that banks provide.&hellip;

						SEC Filing for Northen Star and Apex merger link: S-4 (sec.gov) (wb)
Addendum— these lawsuits are mentioned in an upcoming merger- lawsuits related to the debacle fall out from GME in January - the reason I think it’s a positive thing is the merging brokerage must disclose and they state an increase of awareness of market manipulation and this makes them more liable and also more apt to regard Sec laws.&hellip;

						Hey guys pdwp90 here, founder of Quiver Quantitative (wb) for those of you who don&rsquo;t know me by Reddit tag.
This report is primarily comprised of &ldquo;alternative data&rdquo; which can be loosely thought of as data that comes from outside of traditional sources like earnings reports. The reason this type of data gets me so jacked is because it&rsquo;s data that retail investors (you guys) often have an edge over Wall Street in interpreting.&hellip;
