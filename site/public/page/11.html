						I found this article from 2017 about Citadel hiring an ex-SEC director (wb).
I found it because I saw a fellow ape say &ldquo;if the SEC knew about this shit and did nothing, then the market is fooked.&rdquo;
And I thought, &ldquo;hmm, how do I explain to this ape that of course they know. How? For instance, a ton of them work on Wall Street. Oh! I know. I&rsquo;ll search to see if anyone from the SEC works at Citadel.&hellip;

						TLDR; Long Whales are working the Max Pain Channel; IV + consolidation is approaching levels last seen before GME rose from $4 to $350. The Low Volume and Sideways trading is aligning the stars for a Gamma booster, into the short squeeze launch from a $1,000 platform. Enjoy this beautiful calm before ignition; sleeping soundly tonight, knowing Kenny G isn&rsquo;t.
 Last week I published a report on why Long Whales are orchestrating this channel $175-198 around Max Pain in options market and how it is designed to bleed the Hedge Funds of the funds they have left: Our Whale is Suppressing Volatility to Bleed HFs &ndash; Max Pain Explained (wb)&hellip;

						From previous DD, we&rsquo;ve discovered
1.) BlackRock has the most shares in both AMC/GME, (Marketbeat (wb))
2.) They have a strong relationship tie to Adam Aron (wb), CEO of AMC

						Changed May 16th: Please see Update at bottom of post. Today there is hype about an Italian financial news site reporting that the New York Fed has lent 400 billion USD to 39 financial institutes over the past two days. It concludes that big Wall Street parties have been margin called and are panic borrowing from the Fed to make margin. Link: https://www.money.it/Fed-repo-miliardi-Wall-Street (wb)
None of it is correct.

					<time>Apr 27, 2021</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						TL:DR; after doing two polls and comparing to another user&rsquo;s results, I estimate superstonk users own between 27 million and 35 million shares of GME.
Edit: A very large point of misunderstanding is that the average shares are too high. In statistics, averages are easily skewed by outliers. For example, you have two groups: 3,3,3,2,4,2,4,3 and another 0,0,1,2,10,2,3,4. The average of both is 3. People have said it&rsquo;s impossible for the average person to own $25-30k worth of shares.&hellip;

EDITS:
 in my haste to get this message out to all you apes, my title incorrectly says 2020 Annual Report&hellip; it should say 2021 Annual Report is CORRECTLY referring to the 2020 Annual Report that will be filed in 2021, not the 2019 Annual Report that was filed in 2020, in response to some questions/comments by apes in this and other posts. Thank you u/hdeck for catching that. This is what happens when I take a quick break from work to update the community&hellip; üòÖ u/HolyPhoenician &amp; u/TheKingOfLimbs made excellent points in the comments.&hellip;

						Hi All,
Now that the we are just 7 days away from the shareholder&rsquo;s meeting scheduled for 6/9 I wanted to share some thoughts on what we can possibly expect from the meeting itself.
Gamestop confirmed the meeting for 6/9 at 11am EST and will conclude at 11:15 EST. Dont expect any big announcements during the meeting especially since its only 15 minutes. What usually happens in these meetings is the company will announce the PRELIMINARY results to the proxy vote.&hellip;
