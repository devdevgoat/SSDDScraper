						Edit 1: At the risk of exciting people for no reason, I certainly don&rsquo;t want to set expectations and crash them like how it is happened so many times. Please, instead, see this as evidence that there is something very wrong about GME.
Edit 2: The title should be IMPLIED volatility. Sorry, folks. Was just trying to get this out fast.
Edit 3: Some folks are saying this is IV counteracting theta decay.&hellip;

What follows is highly likely to be nothing more than evidence of my early onset dementia and it is certainly not any kind of advice, but I felt compelled to share it in the event it is a useful puzzle piece to anyone whose has been wondering about a possible relationship between hedge funds and crypto holdings, the sort that have been circling the rumor mill lately.&hellip;

						Hello, fellow apes! ü¶ç First of all, this is not financial advice. Do not take anything I say here as the absolute truth. Make your own due diligence and take your own conclusions.
I stopped going into Reddit and watching the ticker a few days ago because my bias was already 100% confirmed, but yesterday I started to receive comments and awards in my old post: Proxy Voting DD, (wb) and it caught my attention.&hellip;

						Large whales like BlackRock have the obvious potential to initiate a squeeze, were they to recall their large number of loaned out shares, but one thing most of you are missing is until these regulations are locked in they wont &ndash; regardless of the recall/voting. All of you should read these posts below, they very plainly, and brilliantly, lay out what exactly those regs are doing for our whales (and the markets health/safety in general) in great depth, but to give you a simplified version:&hellip;

						I&rsquo;ve spent the last few months reading all the DDs, ingesting all the information, trusting but VERIFYING everything I read.
I&rsquo;ve been here since late last year and I&rsquo;ve been following along extremely closely.
The only way the hedgies and Citadel can STOP the short squeeze is the following:
 They can&rsquo;t. =============  I&rsquo;ve come to the unfortunate conclusion that this is the only option. They simply cannot.

						Hi fellow apes ü¶çü¶çü¶çand welcome to Superstonk!
With these volumes, It looks like everyone took a nap today! Let&rsquo;s take a look at the historical volumes and any relations we can see with share price changes.
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- BOILERPLATE:
I still know nothing, I can&rsquo;t do math good. PLEASE don&rsquo;t listen to me! Obligatory üöÄüöÄüöÄ
TLDR: Today was the lowest volume trading day since Tuesday January 12 (when the price $19.95)! Historically we have seen huge volume trading days (and big price gains) on the Wednesday and guess what tomorrow is?&hellip;
