						&ldquo;It is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperilled in a hundred battles;&rdquo; -Sun Tzu
There are several areas where the MOASS could be hindered. Saying the MOASS will be one straight line up is FUD because people will paperhand the moment it goes down. However, these things may or may not happen, so if you day trade, there is a very large chance you get left behind.&hellip;

Citadel adds a new branch to hide certain holdings (Ashler)
Obtains a large portion of Freddie Mac (percent not known)
Some insane shit goes down in January with their books
Major drama and defaults happen, all connected to Citadel
New rules are passed by the govt in record time because Citadel is way too connected to the housing market/ commercial properties&hellip;

						What&rsquo;s RC plan, does he have a plan?
‚Äã
Here is what I think Ryan Cohens plan is
Ok I have heard allot of talk about stock splits, reverse splits, dividends or crypto dividends ect on how RC can shake the shorts.
None of those really go the whole way. Reverse split is out of the question as the stock is not liquid enough, and there is legal questions surrounding the crypto dividend.&hellip;

I&rsquo;ve been with GME since October last year and seeing how the og of this play versus now is kind of scary to say the least.
I wasn&rsquo;t as early as DFV or Cohen but I got in because I make bet based on people and after literally watching every RC&rsquo;s interview and reading every article I went all in.&hellip;

For people saying that there was a reverse split and that is not a good exemple. Can you provide your source stating this happening in august 2020? The only reverse split I see was in 2018 and thus is irrelevant. The price which shoot from $125 to $25'000 is still a &ldquo;true price&rdquo;
I saw this post saying the fact:

						I posted this almost 2 months ago and folks thought I was wrong or fear mongering. Look at all the DD now and tell me I&rsquo;m wrong. I wish I was wrong because this is a big deal as most of you have learned. Either way, we are going to the fucking moon and beyond!!! Enjoy your tendies when they come because you&rsquo;re going to be the apes who survived it and earned it for holding throughout all the bullshit so far.&hellip;

						Hi ape detectives! Today me (Watson) and our resident Sherlock u/Jerrynka69 bring you a solution to the most recent DFV tweet ( UNO Kitty DFV Tweet (wb) ), cryptically sending us a message like only he, The One Who Is Not a Cat can.
 Firstly, we&rsquo;ll pay attention to highlighted cards which have been edited in. There&rsquo;s 2 decks, one on the left side in hand and one on the right side, probably a discard pile.&hellip;

Speculative post? OR REAL SHIT? I&rsquo;m pretty hyped about April 16th being a doomsday clock for the hedgies, since that&rsquo;s the time they started working the night shift. &ldquo;Give it up for day 15!&rdquo; as Mr. Krabs would say.
Do you like dates? I like dates. I&rsquo;d be happy to take you on one. Just ask. üòâ
I would like apes to pick at this, because I feel like we&rsquo;re really close to finding the secret sauce to the price movements and predicting the next surge (maybe even MOASS ignition).&hellip;

						What is a bust out?
In a bust-out scheme, the identity and credit line of a business are used to obtain loans and goods with no intention of repayment. In some instances, businesses are created for this sole purpose; in others, legitimate businesses are acquired and used for the fraud.

In this post I will go over what I believe is a scheme set out by Amazon to capture and kill companies for market share.&hellip;
