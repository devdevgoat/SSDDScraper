						I honestly can&rsquo;t believe the time and dedication I&rsquo;ve put into GME. This DD is a representation of how much I care about my 2 shares.
The summary was going to be my morning report for tomorrow, but I&rsquo;ve decided I&rsquo;m going to write down the process I take when I think about aspects of the stock market. I hope someone finds this useful.
What is going on in the option chain?&hellip;

						We&rsquo;ve all seen the posts of various office buildings with their lights on at odd hours of the night these last 2 days. Now what is the significance of these you might ask? I&rsquo;m hoping to share some of my thoughts in an effort to connect (more significant) dots for some more wrinkley-brained apes than me.
I&rsquo;ve worked in the NYC Finance scene for well over a decade and can provide insights on how that scene (and buildings) generally operate.&hellip;

INTRODUCTION:
The Gamestop Saga is an ever-evolving story. We have all come such a long way from when we first got involved by buying our first stock, posting memes, and wondering what the heck is going on.&hellip;

						Greetings everyone,
I like to start off saying: This is not financial advice and everyone is open to punch holes in these numbers.
For smooth brain apes TL;DR is at the bottom.
I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of people say: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trust my word, do your own DD&rdquo;. So i did.
I looked at the values on shortvolumes.com (wb). And for a lot of consecutive days, the volume short was more than half the total volume of the day.&hellip;

						EDIT 1: THE MODS DID NOT TAKE DOWN THE POST. THIS WAS A RESULT OF ME ATTEMPTING TO INCLUDE THE STORY BELOW IN EDIT 4 FROM A BLACKLISTED SITE ARTICLE WHICH CAUSED THE AUTOMOD TO DELETE THE POST. I hoped that the removal of the link fixed the text but it didn&rsquo;t, this is a Reddit issue, not a mod one. LAY OFF THE MOD NARRATIVE
EDIT 2: Thank you everyone for the feedback so far; I posted this here as a means to incite further conversation and thoughts.&hellip;

						I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.
Only edit: some of you have been linking me to posts saying that my prediction was just a day early. At first, I didn&rsquo;t think it could be true but now I think there might be some credence because we closed at .01% today and that has only happened 2 other times (went up big the next day). Nevertheless, lets sit back and watch what happens tomorrow.&hellip;

					<time>May 14, 2021</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						TA;DR: I looked at the 605 data - Citadel‚Äôs short position is so huge it‚Äôs distorted the order flow. It‚Äôs so massive you can see it merely by looking at where the GME orders are being executed. It also shows they haven‚Äôt closed.
TL;DR: Opening a huge naked short position requires market maker shenanigans. Leaving it unclosed requires further market maker fucketry. Both of these should be reflected in the proportion of GME shares executed at various market centers.&hellip;

						Citadel owns 1473668 shares of AMD as of February 16th 2021.
AMD posted their earnings results yesterday after close.
EPS 52 vs EPS 44 (estimated). Meaning that they did almost 20% above expectations! Yet, the stock price dropped hard and is still dropping.
Who has 798300 calls and 560100 puts on MVIS? Citadel.
What did MVIS do in the past couple of days? Pumped from 10$ to 31$ and then dumped to 21$ this morning.&hellip;
