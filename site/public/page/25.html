						I&rsquo;m trying a cross-post here, hope I&rsquo;m doing this right, I made some slight improvements after some review on the DD sub.
So hi everybody, I&rsquo;ve been lurking for a while, thought I might have something to contribute to the hive-mind. I&rsquo;m submitting this late at night California time cause it took me a while, it turned out to be very long. Anyway, good morning Euro friends! Can&rsquo;t wait to visit you all again someday!&hellip;

						First of all, a note behind my thinking regarding sending my findings to the SEC and FINRA: Regarding: https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mihbr1/i_have_contacted_the_sec_regarding_my_findings_of/ (wb) if you missed it
There were many of these comments:
 &lsquo;they&rsquo;re not gonna do anything&rsquo; &lsquo;they&rsquo;re in bed with the hedgies&rsquo; &lsquo;now they&rsquo;re gonna halt trading and screw the squeeze&rsquo;  and while some may be from shills (last one especially), the first two are not an unreasonable sentiment to have at this point.&hellip;

						Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m a smooth brainer with a lot of time.
So the reason for this little DD is because of a certain find by u/PapaTheSmurf and his post
https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nd39dl/srnysearca202054_need_some_wrinkles_asap/ (wb)
The finding in question is as follows and it clicked in a couple of missing pieces to a theory I have about our secret whale.
https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysearca/2021/34-91901.pdf (wb)
This rule appears to provide an exemption for companies that fall under ‚Äúinvestment companies‚Äù in obtaining shareholder permission before issuing securities that relate to acquisition of stock or assets of another company.&hellip;

I&rsquo;m u/Doom_Douche , You may remember me from posts such as &ldquo;Deep Dive into Dark Pool Trading - How they might accidentally be showing us the number of synthetic shares&rdquo; (wb) or &ldquo;My banner submission. Let&rsquo;s get back to our roots! ü¶çü§ùüí™&rdquo; (wb)

						Let&rsquo;s delve into some more evidence of market manipulation as well as an explanation of why we see &ldquo;intense&rdquo; price action at market open and close!
It‚Äôs that time of the month! NYSE Order Type data (wb) has finally come through for March-21, we&rsquo;ll delve into it to see what&rsquo;s changed in the month of March-21. Are Shitadel up to their usual shenanigans again? We&rsquo;ll investigate this and more.
There are two things I want to go through before we get into the new order type data:&hellip;

						So today we saw that Union Bank had confirmed to closing over 400 locations. This can be seen through the following post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mv6k4z/union_bank_confirms_emergency_closing_of_over_400/ (wb)
The reason this is very fascinating to observe is because it reveals a much deeper image of their collapsing empire. How does it do that you ask? Well, if you look at the Parent company of Union Bank it turns out it is: MUFG Bank.
From wikipedia:&hellip;
