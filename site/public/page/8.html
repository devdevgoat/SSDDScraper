						Hello Fellow Apes,
I am writing this post to let Apes know that I was able to follow-up through the SEC and the DTCC on SR-DTC-2021-005 and to the follow-up on work in my initial post here (wb), and providing you now with the status update I received.
I would also like to report that the SEC and the DTCC once again were very gracious and timely in their responses.&hellip;

						So, from one smoothbrain to another. Apparently that u/Atobitt (wb) thing with his GOD TIER DD &ldquo;House of cards&rdquo; made some folks very insecure. Fuck, even I was completely devastated yesterday when I read it. With huge efforts I got my first wrinkle after thinking this through. Since I am not a genius, but I still want to pollute the internet like any other moron with my uninformed, unasked opinion, here is what I came up with, in hopes of helping some of you to make the right decision.&hellip;

						*********** I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice ************
Good morning apes, I&rsquo;m back.
Boy is it good to be back, apes. I&rsquo;ve missed you all. I&rsquo;ve been gone for a while but have not left the cause. I&rsquo;ve been lurking in the shadows, jacking off to DD, and huffing WD40. When I was just a child (a boy in Bulgaria), my father said he was going to the store to get cigarettes&hellip; I think he&rsquo;s still there, must&rsquo;ve been a long line for those Marlboros.&hellip;

						Hello, this morning u/rensole did a request in his synopsis to analyse all the Failure-To-Delivers contained in the ETFs. So I made a Python script where I get all the latest FTD data from the 72 ETFs including GME. I will from now on post the FTD data for you apes. I hope you guys enjoy it! ü¶çü¶ç
EDIT: Thank you so much for all your kind words! Love you all!&hellip;

						So, this post is in response to u/HomeDepotHank69 ‚Äòs request for DD into correlation between stock price movements.
TL/DR:
 Two different scientific methods showing that there is similarity and correlation between certain meme stocks and that this increased since Jan. A machine learning method asked to put stonk data into clusters based on their patterns over the last half year put the meme stonks GME, AMC, KOSS, and others together regardless of which bit of price data you choose to look at.&hellip;

						I thought I&rsquo;d summarize some information about the juicy morsel of information that was just discovered. I will try to keep it to information rather than opinion.
As has been rapidly circulating online, https://nft.gamestop.com/ (wb) was discovered. This site is real and official. You cannot fake a subdomain.
It has a curious little thing of numbers and letters near the bottom
Those who aren&rsquo;t in crypto might not know that this is a an ERC (etherium) address.&hellip;

						Nothing in my post should be assumed to accuse anyone of anything.
This is my theory of everything. My Charlie Day-DD. This is, I think, the blueprint for getting us through these last few agonizing days. Sorry, it&rsquo;s walls of text, but I think you&rsquo;ll enjoy reading it.
This will be the only meme.
This is in all likelihood my final statement on the matter until new information comes to light.&hellip;

						Hey Everyone!
What a fucking few days hey? GME closes almost 15% up, streamers that are more interested in their weird tarot card readings than actual data, FUD that we can barely even spot anymore, and an IV increase that is being hidden by a hidden company none of us have even talked about. Wait&hellip; what was that last part? Oh yeah haha, another fucking DTCC that we have all neglected or overlooked or just got buried somewhere.&hellip;
