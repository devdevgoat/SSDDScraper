						CRUCIAL UPDATE: If my theory is correct, I will be renaming this &ldquo;the theory of hank&rdquo;
EDIT 1: Looking similar to 1/13: low volume to start but no morning dip. Look to 10-11 for some action if we see any today.
EDIT 2: ooooooo look, new format. Uncle Hank will now be updating on the top instead of the bottom. Is this new format confirmation that the squeeze is imminent?&hellip;

						Hello Superstonk!
I just wanted to do another compilation this weekend. Re-iterating some old DD I have written as it starts to become applicable to the current situation.
Jefferies and BOA coming out this week and declaring no more short positions would be allowed to be taken, added some weight to a thesis I had come up with a few weeks ago. I was getting frequently asked on reddit and YouTube.&hellip;

						EDIT 1:
First of all, thank you to everyone who has awarded and commented on this post. Honestly, I thought that only 500-700ish people would read this, so the fact that it got this much traction is a surprise.
Secondly, I just want to say that this is all speculation based on some research I did into the figures behind the DTCC. There are most likely things I&rsquo;ve missed, misunderstood, or got wrong.&hellip;

Hi all,
There were a lot of apes in the daily discussion thread wondering why the DD by /u/leavemeanon was gone. Turns out they&rsquo;ve deleted their account for some reason, along with their posts. I did a bit of digging and managed to recover their posts (shoutout to https://camas.github.io/reddit-search (wb)), which I&rsquo;ll be shamelessly reposting as there seems to be some demand:

						APES!
The price you see on your broker is the average price between the bid and the ask. The bid is set by the buyers and the ask is set by the sellers. The market makers (Shitadel and others) make their money on the difference. The more liquid a security (which GME isn&rsquo;t at all, hence the extremely low volume and blatant manipulation) the tighter the spread between the Bid and the Ask.&hellip;

						TL;DR: Too much is going on right now in the financial world for it all NOT to be connected. And if Michael Bury and other financial experts are right, then the United States and other countries across the globe will soon be in a dire economic situation akin to the Great Depression. Where there is smoke, there is fire.
