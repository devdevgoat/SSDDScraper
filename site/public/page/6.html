						Hey there, dildos and dildettes. I normally keep my DD to myself and my friends, but if I can convince my cautious anchor to reality that GME is going to the moon, maybe I can help you do the same.
If you don&rsquo;t have someone keeping you grounded and real, you should. Fiery passion only beats cold hard facts in Julie Garwood novels and succubus hentai.
OBV
OBV = On Balance Volume and typically it follows the price movement closer than Citadel interns follow this sub for the latest image of Kenneth as an alien covered in nipples.&hellip;

						A family member just sent me an article about Gamestop, and other &ldquo;meme&rdquo; stocks. Basically the article tries to spread FUD about investing in &ldquo;meme&rdquo; stocks, with Gamestop being the top of the list.
I read the article, but they provide no convincing arguments with regards to their title. What&rsquo;s interesting though, is that they have a chart showing how much money went into buying Gamestop from Korea. The figure is shown below:&hellip;

After taking my sabbatical where I only drank WD40 and coconut oil, only ate pringles, fig newtons, gushers, and Cheetos, only listened to Fifth Harmony, Megan Thee Stallion, and Linkin Park, only used the bathroom ONCE per day, and only called my wife&rsquo;s boyfriend for 45 minutes per day (thank god that&rsquo;s over, I need my 8 hours), I come to you as an enlightened primate.&hellip;

						Hello Superstonk!
I am just compiling this for those of you that might be interested in the more juicy non-TA parts of my weekly DD&rsquo;s. Since a lot of this was written over several weeks, I wanted to get it all into one place for ease of reference. Any additional exit strategies or information will be added to this post in the future.
For those of you that prefer the Video DD&rsquo;s they can still be found over on my YouTube (wb).&hellip;

Dear Apes,
​
As many of you know, there are multiple reports coming in from various ex-Robinhood apes showing at which prices their shares had to be bought and found in order to finish their transfer to other brokers.&hellip;

First of all: Many thanks for all the great feedback you freaking apes gave me on my initial DD (wb) on r/GME. As some time (around 1 month) has passed and we have some new apes and apettes on board and some new information around my initial assumptions has been updated and revealed, I have decided to work on an updated version of my initial DD. So let&rsquo;s start right away, main changes are as follows:&hellip;

I emphasize &ldquo;might&rdquo;. See below and judge for yourself.
TL;DR:
 On Monday, May 17th, OCC posted an increase to their Clearing Fund of $588,378,155 (wb). This information was found by u/aSphericalCow. In case it isn&rsquo;t clear, OCC is saying that all members must contribute proportionally to add $588m to the common Clearing Fund by Wednesday, May 19 (tomorrow).&hellip;
