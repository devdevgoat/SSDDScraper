A post-shack salute from Uncle Hank Oh boy have I missed you, my Apes. I come to you as a primate reborn. I haven&rsquo;t shaved, showered, or talked to my dad in four months&hellip; yeah this 3-day sabbatical really took a toll on me. After taking my sabbatical where I only drank WD40 and coconut oil, only ate pringles, fig newtons, gushers, and Cheetos, only listened to Fifth Harmony, Megan Thee Stallion, and Linkin Park, only used the bathroom ONCE per day, and only called my wife&rsquo;s boyfriend for 45 minutes per day (thank god that&rsquo;s over, I need my 8 hours), I come to you as an enlightened primate.&hellip;

						Hello Superstonk!
I am just compiling this for those of you that might be interested in the more juicy non-TA parts of my weekly DD&rsquo;s. Since a lot of this was written over several weeks, I wanted to get it all into one place for ease of reference. Any additional exit strategies or information will be added to this post in the future.
For those of you that prefer the Video DD&rsquo;s they can still be found over on my YouTube (wb).&hellip;

Dear Apes,

As many of you know, there are multiple reports coming in from various ex-Robinhood apes showing at which prices their shares had to be bought and found in order to finish their transfer to other brokers.&hellip;

First of all: Many thanks for all the great feedback you freaking apes gave me on my initial DD (wb) on r/GME. As some time (around 1 month) has passed and we have some new apes and apettes on board and some new information around my initial assumptions has been updated and revealed, I have decided to work on an updated version of my initial DD. So let&rsquo;s start right away, main changes are as follows:&hellip;

I emphasize &ldquo;might&rdquo;. See below and judge for yourself.
TL;DR:
 On Monday, May 17th, OCC posted an increase to their Clearing Fund of $588,378,155 (wb). This information was found by u/aSphericalCow. In case it isn&rsquo;t clear, OCC is saying that all members must contribute proportionally to add $588m to the common Clearing Fund by Wednesday, May 19 (tomorrow).&hellip;

						Congratulations to everyone wo had bought the dip in the disccounts of today. Sorry for my english  Hi again, I published this post yesterday The SR-NSCC-2021-801 CAN be approved AUTOMATICALLY this week. (MAY THE 4TH BE WITH YOU). (wb)
I saw some people saying that this rules had changes. But anyone could confirm that if these changes can change the rule of 60 days. So I decided to send an email to the people who propose the law changes.&hellip;

MAY 7th Edit: They have postponed the ruling until June 21st, please see my followup post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n6zgng/nsc002_delayed_for_longer_period_of_comment_and/
I haven&rsquo;t seen as much talk about this, yet it is the biggest news to come and IT IS the endgame catalyst.
NSCC-801 Passed with no objections yesterday. For this rule to enter effect it needs to piggyback on NSCC-002, which if no objections are made again, will be passed this Friday.&hellip;

						Hi all, Blanderson here, back this time with all the DD you wanted in a story you didn&rsquo;t ask for.
Here are 100+ DDs that have shaped the GME saga.
This is the story of you, Apes, and the DD writers who have held us together and made us proud. As always, I hope you will enjoy.
I polled the Daily Chat about the name of this post and wanted to shout out some of the top alternatives.&hellip;

						Some people are getting a little confused. These &ldquo;auctions&rdquo; are not for GME stonk or any other stock for that matter. These are for open options contracts in other companies that have yet to expire and will need to be sold to cover short positions. The OCC handles all options transactions while the NSCC handles securities (stocks) transactions.
This rule is set to drop tomorrow (April 6, 2021) on the federal register.&hellip;
