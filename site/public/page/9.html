						Hello apes/retards,
I&rsquo;d like to provide an update to my previous post (wb) which outlines the possibility that BlackRock is in the process of deleting Shitadel out of existence. As of this morning, FINRA has reported no major material changes to its list of major institutional shareholders. However, it maintains the position of BlackRock Fund Advisors at &amp; around 14 million shares.
For the past few weeks, I&rsquo;ve been periodically reviewing the SEC&rsquo;s page on BlackRock&rsquo;s subsidiary firm (wb) in the hopes that a 13G or 13F would pop up indicating of the change in ownership.&hellip;

Hi all,
There were a lot of apes in the daily discussion thread wondering why the DD by /u/leavemeanon (wb) was gone. Turns out they&rsquo;ve deleted their account for some reason, along with their posts. I did a bit of digging and managed to recover their posts (shoutout to https://camas.github.io/reddit-search (wb)), which I&rsquo;ll be shamelessly reposting as there seems to be some demand:&hellip;

						Important - See edit 2 at bottom of my write up.
A lot of calls have been added this week on top of what was already the most stacked options week for GME by far. There are no other weeks on the board that are even close to this week. The closest, in July is barely half by volume.
I&rsquo;ll give the quick rundown on calls for the smooth brained and new apes to make sure you understand.&hellip;

has anyone seen the new UPDATED form posted by the DTCC?
FINAL EDIT!!!!: I think we might be wrong on this one. I’m sorry to kill the hype but I am thinking that this has less to do with GME. I’m not 100% sure tho, I would really like to hear from some of the credentialed big brains like u/atobitt and u/rensole. Again I am an ape just like you guys just wanted to get exposure on something that I saw as possibly huge.&hellip;

						Hello apes/retards. I&rsquo;d like to propose a theory in regards to some of the data that&rsquo;s been floating around over the past few days.
So far, we&rsquo;ve seen data published by FINRA (wb) which describes total equity ownership ~192%. Many people have insinuated that this % is not accurate due to duplicates of the same entity. However, you can verify that some these entities are not the same, and represent transactions from parent&gt;child or entirely separate positions held by affiliates.&hellip;

Since I can barely read/write myself, I&rsquo;ll keep this short and get straight to the point. There are way too many DD&rsquo;s out there, written by apes way wiser than me, with DETAILED explanations of everything I&rsquo;m talking about.

						Good Evening Apes,
Hope all of you are getting settled in nicely here in our new sanctuary. I remind you that you all turn this place from house into a home. Let&rsquo;s get right into it.
Many of you may know me from my previous posts depicting the Deep ITM calls being bought out of the PHLX exchange. Interestingly enough, for the first time since this whole thing started, no large trades of Deep ITM calls were made.&hellip;

						Hello Apes,
Cheers to all the hedge funds forcing my brain into growing a few wrinkles! I wouldn&rsquo;t be here today without you! Y&rsquo;all ready for that dank confirmation bias? Don&rsquo;t forget to puff puff pass this on to any relevant subreddits.
​
We all &ldquo;know&rdquo; there is some major fudgery going on. One of the areas I personally understood the least was Dark Pools or OTC trading. I am not going to pretend I have a masters in economics or hell that I even finished college, but I can assure you I have a black belt in google and know how to operate a spreadsheet.&hellip;
