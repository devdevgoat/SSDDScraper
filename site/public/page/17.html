						Okay Apes, The DD has been done, The DD has been consumed by apes and there has been no rebuttal to the facts of our DD anywhere. There is new stuff coming out but by now we all should know that it is inevitable. The MOASS could happen any day now. There are a lot of possible catalysts approaching fast that each on their own could launch us to Andromeda.&hellip;

						Actual post is below under the line, here is a long edit in response to FUD-packers.
EDIT: Thank you SO much for response, i am overwhelmed and titjacked from your feedback! Thanks!
In response to some FUDPOSTERS arguing to the point that this is not an official SEC communication. Well duh. The first line in this post is clearly saying whats up: &ldquo;its a speech published on SEC website&rdquo;. The speech partially describes what SEC is up to, like LIBOR-stuff and the coming meme-stock report.&hellip;

TL;DR: Margin is calling. Below is a list of a bunch of other stocks that SPECIFICALLY CITADEL is shorting into oblivion to make money to pay for their debt. Oh, by the way, it&rsquo;s not working out for them.
Not financial advice. I just like the stock. All of them.
I&rsquo;ll keep this short and sweet, it&rsquo;s just a bunch of Ortex/FINRA data on stocks that Citadel is MASS PRINTING to make their money back.&hellip;

						Apes,
As they like to say in the business: No news is good news. Today I bring you not a single ounce of news regarding these deep in the money calls. Not even so much as a peep out of the HF&rsquo;s buying these calls.
This officially rules out the idea that yesterday was just some crazy coincidence. The time of covering FTD&rsquo;s with Deep ITM calls has come to an end.&hellip;

As always, this aint no mothafuckin financial advice, hoe. The views expressed here are solely my approach to investing in this specific equity. I ape an am.
obligatory.
To preface, for any new apes, I am a daily technical trader. I make a living by identifying patterns and executing trades based solely on what I see on my charts.&hellip;

						This post is simply putting few facts together and my own interpretation of what it means in the Squeeze to come. This is not a financial advice, just the opinion of a humble Ape with couple of wrinkles.
Mods, please review and flag as appropriate. Apes, feel free to comment, correct or debate. At the end of the day this is my opinion, not better than any of yours.
In this post, I am going to cover what is happening to the VIX, what is happening with the 10 Year treasury note, its link to inflation, and why all this is the beginning of the end of the GME saga, and I believe the squeeze is getting closer (no dates provided if that is what you are after, sorry).&hellip;

						I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of comments from people wondering why shills are working for hedge funds, after reading the DD because it&rsquo;s pretty clear they&rsquo;re going to be out of a job very soon.
I actually put some thought into the situation after this exchange and I believe it&rsquo;s a common misconception. The majority of shills out there on Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube aren&rsquo;t Citadel interns or hired off of LinkedIn.&hellip;

					<time>May 20, 2021</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						I think that Robinhood has a big problem on their hands (no surprises there). Maybe I never understood PFOF until now, but here is a breakdown of how they were stealing my money and fudging the receipts when I bought fractional shares with them. I would highly recommend that anyone else who bought fractional shares of GME from Robinhood, and then transferred to another broker, check the reported costs.
On Jan 27, 2021 I opened a Robinhood account and spent $300 on fractional shares of GME right at market close and into after market hours.&hellip;
