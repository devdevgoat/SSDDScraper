			<p>I have been taking some looks at the Level 2 information and it seems that when &ldquo;they&rdquo; want to drop the price, &ldquo;they&rdquo; use smaller lots of bids and asks - today was lots of 11 - 11 shares were being traded back and forth the entire time we saw a drop in the price down by $10. Other apes have noticed this before. See image 1.</p>

<p>I then noticed they stopped trading in these lots, see image 2 below. It went back to the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; lots of 100 shares each. I also happened to notice that yesterday (April 21st) &ldquo;they&rdquo; did not use this smaller lot tactic to lower the price, there were only these large lots of 100 basically. I think they may have thought sentiment had changed, maybe they saw a shift in our community and decided this would be the best time to make it drop and seem like people are selling</p>

<p>I then noticed this sell wall go up. See image 3 1450, at 149. I think they are lowering the price, then trying to prevent it from going back up.</p>

<p>I think they may have raised capital to prevent a margin call and potentially keep this whole charade going longer than they expect. They may be using DD against us that are promising dates to generate fatigue. I think we are in for a longer haul than we might expect here. Don&rsquo;t lose interest.</p>
<p><del>They may be synthetically inflating some cryptocurrencies to prevent a margin call. Look at this shit:</del></p>

<p>Edit 2: Check out this post on &ldquo;odd lots&rdquo;:</p>

<p>I am a bit too smooth brained to figure out exactly what they might be doing here.</p>
