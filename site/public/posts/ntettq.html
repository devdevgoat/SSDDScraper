			<p>Ok guys I&rsquo;ve been investing for awhile, Im not the most wrinkle brain but I&rsquo;ve got a few&hellip; I&rsquo;ve invested in long term value stock, dividend stocks, but my favorite type (before I YOLO&rsquo;ed it all in Gamestop) was the sub-penny stocks&hellip;</p>
<p>(Please hang in there while I explain the opposite of GME)</p>
<p>For all you smooth brain apes out there a sub-penny stock trades between .0001 and .0009 and you have the oppertunity to make alot of money.. (well what I thought was alot, before I realized the potential of GME) Let&rsquo;s say you buy 1,000,000 shares of a company at
.0001 for 1000$ and 2 days later you sell that stock for 
.0004. Guess what? you just made 3000 dollers. Pretty good huh&hellip;</p>
<p>Well now your feeling pretty fucking good about what you just did&hellip; so you take all those tendies and confidence, and you wolf of wallstreet that shit into a cool million shares of another company at .0004 ($4000) then the next day it goes down 0003.. fuck, 0002, 0001. And you keep holding it&hellip;.. you think it&rsquo;s going to go back up but it doesn&rsquo;t&hellip; Eventually you have had enough. You think ahh fuck, whatever, I&rsquo;ll just sell it at .0001 and get out with my initial investment, right?</p>
<p>(HA HA HA!! fuck no!)</p>
<p>Why not? Well sometimes with these types of stocks they go into what&rsquo;s called a no bid&hellip;. and that&rsquo;s when you are the bag holder in every sence of the word. You can put a sell order in at .0001 but it will not execute. Why? Because nobody wants to buy it&hellip;. Believe me I put a good till closed limit order in on one and that expired I did that 4 times before it finally sold&hellip; It took years BTW&hellip;..</p>
<p>(This is where Gamestop comes in and why it has almost unlimited potential if you HODL)</p>
<pre><code>I was snacking on a box of 96 today and had an Apepiffiny... What happens when they need to buy but nobody is selling...

</code></pre><p>So, as all apes know by now, gamestop is shorted&hellip;. A Fuckton&hellip; 200% 300% 400% 1000% who knows? We will find out soon, either way&hellip;. The shorts MUST cover!!</p>
<pre><code>And this being the case, along with a new breed of traders (Apes with üíé‚úã).. The likes of which the market has never seen before....  Will put us in a unique situation that I don't believe has ever occured.....

</code></pre><p>In walks&hellip;.. THE NO ASK!!!!</p>
<p>The Bid during the MOASS will just keep rising to the next ask &hellip;. 10,000 shares at 1000&hellip; Then 20,000 shares at 2000&hellip; So on and so forth till all the paper hands have folded. All that&rsquo;s left is a huge army of great üíé‚úãü¶ç&hellip; And all of the sudden, the ask is blank&hellip;. The last traded price is there. The shorts still need to cover so the Bid starts rising&hellip; above the last traded price, still the ask is blank&hellip; It keeps going and going and going until one of us apes decides, well that seems like a fair price for 10 shares. $20,000,000$ done&hellip; Ape sell 10.. his account has 200,000,000$. GME Price goes to 20,000,000 stock goes to no ask again, bid rises untill another ape decides to sell, 25mil, 30mil, 32mil, 40mil.. Untill all the shorts have covered</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not positive, but I don&rsquo;t believe volume will matter during the MOASS. The Bid will simply rise to the next ask and the shares will be bought&hellip; towards the end.. when the only shares left to cover are owned by Apes&hellip; I hope we all get to witness fellow apes HODLing.. with the No Ask&hellip;</p>
<p>I have only a few wrinkles and I&rsquo;m not a financial advisor&hellip; Just a guy who has experienced the opposite of the situation we are currently in&hellip;</p>
<p>And my Tits are jacked&hellip;.</p>
