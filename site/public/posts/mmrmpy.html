<p>Will still stream tomorrow, but will be gone between 10am EDT and 11:15am EDT for a midterm so will pause the stream then.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 29 4:00PM:</strong></p>
<p>Ending around 170.24, down 4.34%. Overall downwards day on low volume. Nothing too crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 28 3:21PM:</strong></p>
<p>Pretty consistent block of buying volume. Possible confirmation of a bounce.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 26 2:42PM:</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sold my tea leaves on ebay and used the proceeds to buy a share of GME.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 25 2:38PM:</strong></p>
<p>The positive news today has fudged up my timing, but yes, there is a dip cooking right now.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 24 2:37PM:</strong></p>
<p>SSR is at 160.17.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 23 2:32PM:</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really amusing how shorts can drop the price so much with almost no volume.</p>
<p><img src="../img/xx7skqhztzr61.png" alt="">
<strong>Edit 22 2:27PM:</strong></p>
<p>Maybe I need to spend some money on some premium tea leaves.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 21 2:22PM:</strong></p>
<p>I guess there is a discount today after all! Thanks Ken!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 20 2:19PM:</strong></p>
<p>No volume here folks. &lt;60k on average per minute candle. As Uncle Bruce likes to say, &ldquo;they want to make the stock look awful&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Honestly the stock looks great to me because I like the stock.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 19 2:18PM:</strong></p>
<p>My tea leaves have lied to me.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 18 2:05PM:</strong></p>
<p>Around 10k volume a minute. So low&hellip;. A bit higher than yesterday but it&rsquo;s still crazy low.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 17 1:47PM:</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading my tea leaves right now and it says double bottom.</p>

<strong>Edit 15 1:32PM:</strong></p>
<p>GME trading like a penny stock again. Such low volume!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 14 1:02PM:</strong></p>
<p>Prediction for the day: - - - - - - - -&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Edit 13 12:35PM:</strong></p>
<p>As for option sonar, these puts were sold. So nothing bad. Typically a bullish sign.</p>
<p><img src="../img/qqrdhue59zr61.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Edit 12 12:30PM:</strong></p>
<p>Basically a split itself doesn&rsquo;t trigger covering. But a recall of shares to vote on a split would. Scratch out point B, now that I think about it, they will have covered anyways before the split happens. Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong. So the cheaper price shouldn&rsquo;t factor in. However it is good for post squeeze, as retail can buy in cheaply.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 11 12:16PM:</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk strategy.</p>
<p>IV seems to have a hard time going any lower. They will likely keep this trading sideways until the next catalyst.</p>
<p><img src="../img/rszdaggq5zr61.png" alt="">
My best guess is <strong>a share recall for a stock split. This is pure speculation but this would be a great move in my opinion. A) it forces shorts to cover. B) (edit) it makes the stock cheap so tons of retail can buy back in post squeeze.</strong> This seems like a perfect infinity squeeze setup as well as a good post squeeze recovery.</p>
<p>Will we continue to trade sideways into 4/16? Yes that&rsquo;s possible. All for the sake of keeping IV low. This largely depends on if they do a share recall announcement, and when.</p>
<p><strong>My best guess for the future, is that IF a share recall is announced, we may see some major action. Most probably sometime between next week and 4/20&hellip; blaze it ;) !</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edit 10 12:04PM:</strong></p>
<p>Please read the recall post :D</p>
<p><strong>Edit 9 11:46AM:</strong></p>
<p>Since I didn&rsquo;t have time to read on stream, I read it now and would like you all to do the same, <strong>please read this about contacting your brokers and the share recall:</strong></p>

<p>Ok stream is back up, the YouTube editing tools kind of suck. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih79GhTXRdA&amp;ab_channel=WardenElite">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih79GhTXRdA&amp;ab_channel=WardenElite</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih79GhTXRdA&amp;ab_channel=WardenElite">(wb)</a></p>
<p><strong>Edit 7 11:21AM:</strong></p>
<p><strong>New support added at 174.</strong></p>
<p>We seemed to have bottomed out.</p>
<p><img src="../img/zevyu0qxvyr61.png" alt="">
Edit 6 11:20AM:</p>
<p>Gonna just trim out the roofing hammering parts so I&rsquo;ve made the stream inaccessible for a bit. I&rsquo;ll have it back up later today.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 5 10:26AM:</strong></p>
<p>Seems it&rsquo;s the 40% chance option. I don&rsquo;t think we will get a 5%-10% discount, but we can dip further.</p>
<p><img src="../img/lnhymrn2myr61.png" alt="">
<strong>Edit 4 9:56AM:</strong></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll likely see an ascending channel soon. 9:50AM seemed to have happened.</p>
<p><img src="../img/lnxv7ugrgyr61.png" alt="">
<strong>Edit 3 9:45AM:</strong></p>
<p>Important points on the Form 8k.</p>
<p><img src="../img/ockx8geseyr61.png" alt="">
<strong>Edit 2 9:34AM:</strong></p>
<p>Swing traders exiting at open. Nothing too crazy. Almost 1 million volume first minute. Pretty decent volume.</p>
<p><img src="../img/n0cpc8dtcyr61.png" alt="">
<strong>Edit 1 9:18AM:</strong></p>
<p>Sorry <strong>I will not be streaming today</strong>. My neighbors are doing roof repair and it&rsquo;s loud as heck. They are straight up replaced their entire roof so there&rsquo;s going to be banging and sawing all day.</p>

<p>Gooooooood morning my beautiful silverback apes!</p>
<p>Ah yes. The 10% odds have hit. <strong>No discount today my friends :D</strong></p>
<p>To quote myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Forget options chain, forget TA, what&rsquo;s coming soon is <strong>a chain of business maneuvers that can push the price.</strong> So whether that be a share recall, <strong>a change in leadership</strong>, big business changes are underway. Eventually we&rsquo;ll likely walk out of the eye of the storm, and get flung into the sky and catch a rocket to the moon :D</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like Cohen and Grube have just leveled up. Melvin and friends' plan to short today just got STOMPED. It&rsquo;s like Cohen picked up the invincibility power up and now he&rsquo;s stomping the hell out of the shorts.</p>
