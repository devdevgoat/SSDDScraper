			<p>&ldquo;It is said that if you <strong>know your enemies</strong> and <strong>know yourself</strong>, you will not be imperilled in a hundred battles;&rdquo; -Sun Tzu</p>
<p>There are several areas where the MOASS could be hindered. <strong>Saying the MOASS will be one straight line up is FUD because people will paperhand the moment it goes down.</strong> However, these things may or may not happen, so <strong>if you day trade, there is a very large chance you get left behind</strong>. Remember we&rsquo;re up against a lot of big players, even if other players like Blackrock are on our side. Here are just two main areas where they may be a dip.</p>
<h1 id="delay-on-margin-call">Delay on Margin Call</h1>
<p>First of all, unlike what some people think, margin calls are not instant (<a href="https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/understanding-margin-accounts">finra</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210506162241/https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/understanding-margin-accounts">(wb)</a>). <strong><del>You have two to five days to pass a margin call</del></strong> <del>before they start liquidating assets.</del> Smaller hedge funds will fail the margin call and get liquidated first. This may start the rocket. If the rocket starts before the margin call is finished for Citadel, Citadel still has some time before they get liquidated. <del>Two to five days is for the average investor. Who knows how long Citadel, a market maker, could extend that period of time?</del></p>
<p>Update: The NSC 801 only gives Citadel one hour to fulfil liquidity requirements. However, once liquidated, the NSCC has to close their positions within the settlement date. Which is typically T+2. (Thanks for the source, /u/Ginger_libra)</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/h8a8p7uvsw071.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We all know Ken&rsquo;s philosophy of <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-xpm-2013-05-22-ct-biz-0522-confidential-griffin-20130522-story.html">one more day</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210523181643/https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-xpm-2013-05-22-ct-biz-0522-confidential-griffin-20130522-story.html">(wb)</a>. He will not give up, ever. He would rather the whole economy tank before he does. The squeeze will only happen after he has done everything to suppress it and fail. However, once he inevitably fails, we&rsquo;re not out of the woods yet, because now we&rsquo;re threatening a new player, the DTCC.</p>
<h1 id="the-dtcc-taking-over">The DTCC Taking over</h1>
<p>Remember, <strong>THE DTCC DOES NOT WANT THE PRICE TO HIT 10 MILLION</strong>. The DTCC doesn&rsquo;t want to pay out of pocket at all, that&rsquo;s why there are so many new rules. They&rsquo;re hoping the squeeze stops at ~5k, or even lower because higher prices mean the DTCC has to pay out of pocket. At higher prices, the DTCC has to liquidate its members. Banks will lose massive amounts of money and assets and the US will undergo turmoil. <strong>All of these new rules, such as auctioning off assets, won&rsquo;t matter at 10 million.</strong> At 10 million per share, the DTCC will be forced to liquidate banks like Credit Suisse and JPMorgan, causing a huge chain reaction across the market. Do you think the big banks are going to sit quietly while they get liquidated?</p>
<p><strong>What if other market makers are forced to Naked Short Gamestop to survive because if GME goes too high, the DTCC will be forced to liquidate them?</strong></p>
<h1 id="dtc-005-a-rule-too-good-for-this-world">DTC-005, a rule too good for this world</h1>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of DTC-005 by now, if you haven&rsquo;t, the simple version is that it stops the naked shorting of stocks, at least, you can&rsquo;t delay them with options anymore. While you can still naked short for liquidity, you can&rsquo;t delay them for longer than a week. This means the naked shorting of GME will never happen again. However, this rule was completely taken down, and no timelines are given when they&rsquo;ll be back up. <strong>Without this rule, GME can be naked shorted by any market maker.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Isn&rsquo;t it a bit weird that this rule is the only one to have been completely removed?</strong></p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/cib/markets/execute/fxtrading">J.P. Morgan</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201031052904/https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/cib/markets/execute/fxtrading">(wb)</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Credit+suisse+market+maker&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA905CA905&amp;oq=Credit+suisse+market+maker&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4247j1j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Credit Suisse</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210523181529/https://www.google.com/search?q=Credit+suisse+market+maker&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA905CA905&amp;oq=Credit+suisse+market+maker&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4247j1j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">(wb)</a> have market-making capabilities (There are more in the DTCC). This means they can naked short stocks just like Citadel. However, they don&rsquo;t appear to have shorted Gamestop. They WILL NOT get margin called with Citadel.</p>
<p>However, as DTCC members, they&rsquo;ll be forced to pay up assets to buy GME and close naked short positions. If GME goes too high, to the point where they&rsquo;ll have to sell everything. . . They may be forced to try and halt the squeeze or end it prematurely to avoid liquidation. If they mass naked short a stock, and <strong>you can short a stock during a squeeze</strong>, as there have been historical precedents for it, the price will dip. . . temporarily.</p>
<p>Obviously, nothing can be done long term. Eventually, the squeeze will continue, and it will continue much higher than before, as all the shorts will just be fuel for the rocket. In fact, naked shorting Gamestop is not only reckless but extremely bad for the global economy. But. . .</p>
<p><img src="../img/vcbunx3zrw071.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>The only way this squeeze will stop is if a short attack causes apes to paperhand.</strong></p>
<p><strong>DO NOT BELIEVE THE IDEA THAT THE SQUEEZE WILL BE STRAIGHT UP</strong></p>
<p>The banks aren&rsquo;t going to sit by quietly while all of their assets are being liquidated. They&rsquo;ll fight back tooth and nail, just like Citadel did. If you want to change the world, be prepared for a world-changing fight. <strong>Even if the DTC-005 gets approved before the squeeze, the market makers can still naked short stocks for a few days for &ldquo;liquidity&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p>Update: DTC-005 to be approved &ldquo;soon&rdquo; with no dates given. That seems extremely suspicious to me. It&rsquo;s been months since the rule was taken down, and even now there are no dates given.</p>
<p>You may see the money dip from 500k to 200k, you may feel like the squeeze is over after it falls 3 days in a row, but in reality, that could just be more market manipulation.</p>
<p>So what do we do? The same thing we&rsquo;ve always done.</p>
<p><strong>HODL through all dips. We own the float. Trust the DD. Trust the community. 10 million or nothing, lambos or food stamps.</strong></p>
<p>Not financial advice. Exit your positions when you feel comfortable. I personally only feel comfortable exiting when I see real change when these scammers are put behind bars and corrupt politicians step down.</p>
<h1 id="is-my-money-safe-in-x-and-x-bank">Is my money safe in X and X bank?</h1>
<p>What I believe happens is that your assets are safe because those assets are not equal to the bank&rsquo;s assets. However, you may have a bit of trouble accessing them if the banks go bankrupt, and it takes a little bit to swap the relevant information to another bank. I personally believe the US gov will bail the banks out again, but just in case, I suggest having GME in multiple brokerages.</p>
<p>Edit 1: &ldquo;Reposting&rdquo; with a bunch more information</p>
<p>Edit 2: Wow, that&rsquo;s a lot of comments. I&rsquo;ll try to answer every question in the comments, but might take me a bit tho.</p>
<p>Edit 3: Wow, my first time getting platinum. Thanks for that kind stranger! I didn&rsquo;t even know there was an exclusive club for those people. Not that I do anything but spend time on Superstonk and write DD, mind you.</p>
<p>Edit 4: I have since lost my flair because I was trying to make sure everyone in my comments voted. Whoops. One more small sacrifice to the cause.</p>
<p>Edit 5: NSC-801 Changes Margin rules</p>
<p>Edit 6: Two Platinum Awards? holy shit guys. I&rsquo;m honoured. Now I can <del>blow it all on DFV&rsquo;s post</del> responsibly award good new posts to make sure it gets to the top.</p>
