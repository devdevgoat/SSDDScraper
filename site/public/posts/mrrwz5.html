I would just like to firstly say this is just theory, don&rsquo;t listen to anything I say as i&rsquo;m a smooth brain.
So if you didn&rsquo;t see yesterday JP Morgan&rsquo;s net profit soars 5-fold to $14.3 billion (wb). I find this to be a little unlikely to be honest. We are on the the biggest bull run this market has ever seen, and the money printers keep on running." />

<p>I would just like to firstly say this is just theory, don&rsquo;t listen to anything I say as i&rsquo;m a smooth brain.</p>
<p>So if you didn&rsquo;t see yesterday JP Morgan&rsquo;s net profit soars <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jp-morgan-net-profit-soars-5-fold-to-143-billion-and-revenue-tops-expectations-but-stock-slips-2021-04-14">5-fold to $14.3 billion</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210414154930/https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jp-morgan-net-profit-soars-5-fold-to-143-billion-and-revenue-tops-expectations-but-stock-slips-2021-04-14">(wb)</a>. I find this to be a little unlikely to be honest. We are on the the biggest bull run this market has ever seen, and the money printers keep on running. You honestly think a bank isn&rsquo;t going to get greedy when the going is hot? of course not. <strong>They have over-leveraged hedge funds and they realize shits gonna go down.</strong></p>

<p>Coincidentally, one day after their so-called killer earnings they issue <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-15/jpmorgan-to-sell-13-billion-of-bonds-in-largest-bank-sale-ever">13 Billion worth in bonds</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210415192922/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-15/jpmorgan-to-sell-13-billion-of-bonds-in-largest-bank-sale-ever">(wb)</a> in the &ldquo;<strong>largest deal ever by a bank</strong>&rdquo;. My thoughts are that they were loaning too much money, in desperation to get enough money to keep them afloat they issued these bonds. They are definitely well aware of the GME situation and there are many catalysts are going together are the one time, they&rsquo;re spooked. Don&rsquo;t think banks don&rsquo;t lie about their positions or aren&rsquo;t that stupid to over-leverage? Read this about Bill Hwang leaving Credit Suisse holding a massive <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2021/04/06/credit-suisse-takes-47-billion-hit-following-archegos-collapse/amp/">$4.7 Billion dollar bag.</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210407061241/https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2021/04/06/credit-suisse-takes-47-billion-hit-following-archegos-collapse/amp/">(wb)</a> No one has learned a fucking thing from 2008 and now people have to suffer again because of billionaires being greedy. They are gonna be holding the biggest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K05sxfa4zdM">bag of excrement.</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K05sxfa4zdM">(wb)</a></p>

<p>Just a side note; It&rsquo;s been noted that Warren Buffet has really cut away on some of his <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-pared-down-its-bank-holdings-that-looks-like-a-10-billion-mistake-51616500847">bank stocks</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210416133342/https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-pared-down-its-bank-holdings-that-looks-like-a-10-billion-mistake-51616500847">(wb)</a> [<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/16/investing/berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-stocks/index.html">additional source</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210416020557/https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/16/investing/berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-stocks/index.html">(wb)</a>]. Also, with Michael Burry <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/big-short-michael-burry-deletes-twitter-profile-warning-market-bubbles-2021-4-1030275994">deleting his twitter</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210416070219/https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/big-short-michael-burry-deletes-twitter-profile-warning-market-bubbles-2021-4-1030275994">(wb)</a> this would lead me to believe that the wrinkly brains actually know what&rsquo;s going on. Something big is about to happen. I believe that GME wont be it&rsquo;s own thing. I firmly think the GME margin call will be a catalyst for an even bigger bubble lurking over.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/twyeq0x9rft61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>TLDR: banks loan out too many bananas to hedgies, and GME has the potential to be a catalyst for an even bigger bubble popping.</strong></p>

<p>edit: getting a lot of downvotes but no one giving counter DD in the comments. Hello shills, whistleblowing to the SEC can earn you a lot of money. Just give it a consideration.🙂</p>
<p>edit 2: <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-jpm-ceo-commercial-031501920.html"><strong>Jpmorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Commercial Banking Douglas B Petno Sold $1.7 million of Shares</strong></a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210416094409/https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-jpm-ceo-commercial-031501920.html">(wb)</a> <strong>-</strong> this news just came out today (16th April 2021). Now i know this seems conveniently timed. Just remember $1.7 million is chump-change to these people so i wouldn&rsquo;t read too much into it that they are expecting Armageddon, I say he is just doing some profit taking. Regardless, market watch articles pumping bank stocks around the same time is convenient to say the least.</p>
