			<p>Alright apes and apettes. Like the rest of you, I am jacked to the TITS after seeing the recent Gamestop <a href="https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/node/18846/html#toc122967_9">14A filing</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210423100225/https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/node/18846/html">(wb)</a>. I wanted to see what the remaining float was and if retail ownership really could be over 100%. So what&rsquo;s the remaining float after insider and institutional ownership?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>Outstanding Float</strong></p>
<p>As per the 14A filing, there are 70,771,778 Gamestop shares outstanding. Institutional Ownership (minus Ryan Cohen&rsquo;s LLC) comes out to 32,433,338 . Insider Ownership (All Gamestop Directors and Officers as a group (20 persons)) comes out to 11,674,085.00 .</p>
<p>​</p>
<ul>
<li>70,771,778 (Outstanding Float) - 32,433,338 (Institutional) - 11,674,085 (Insider) = <strong>26,664,355.00 Floating Stock</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>​</p>
<p>So I only took into account some of the most popular US Brokerages and tried to get the most recent data on the amount of users per platform (I have my sources down below).</p>
<p>Obviously this is an incomplete data set as I left out a lot of brokerages, but assuming an average of 5 shares owned by all Gamestop owners from these top US brokerages, we own <strong>104% of the float.</strong> Remember this isn&rsquo;t taking into account non US brokerages and other US brokerages.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>The Sheet</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/w5ip8pwcdwu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Ok now here is where my data falls short (heh). I didn&rsquo;t delve too deep into how many users on each trading platform actually own Gamestop stock, so I used conservative estimates (at least I think these are conservative). If you guys have any insight on to the actual % of users on each platform that own Gamestop, please share.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean?</strong></p>
<p>It means we fucking buy and hodl. Every trading day more and more apes are buying shares, with volume getting lower and lower. We easily own at least 100% of the float and there is no way it can be less when taking into account all brokerages and people that actually own Gamestop. Think about the people with xxx and even xxxx shares on this very subreddit. I personally think that the average shares per user is 15+ shares.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: If retail ownership averages to <strong>100 shares per individual</strong>, then we own <strong>2089%</strong> of the float. holy fucking moly.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>Sources for Brokerage Total Users</strong></p>
<p>I used brokerages' latest Assets Under Management data to get total users when I could.</p>

<p><strong>Spreadsheet if you wanna add your own data, etc.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/q8iib79i5y089r5/Gamestop%20Retail%20Ownership%201.0.xlsx?dl=0"><strong>https://www.dropbox.com/s/q8iib79i5y089r5/Gamestop%20Retail%20Ownership%201.0.xlsx?dl=0</strong></a> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/q8iib79i5y089r5/Gamestop%20Retail%20Ownership%201.0.xlsx?dl=0">(wb)</a></p>
<p>Here is the spreadsheet I made. Please feel free to add your own brokerages and corresponding data on your own sheet. I would love to make a master spreadsheet with all known brokerages and user counts so we can see just how unfathomable retail ownership is and how deep the hedgies really are.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> 🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀🌕</p>
<p>When I have more time and feel like procrastinating on school, I will try to expand this spreadsheet.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Edit 1: Changed share link. I appreciate everyone that added other brokerages, even foreign ones! I&rsquo;ll add them once I get the chance.</p>
