<p><strong>Edit 13 4:00PM:</strong></p>
<p>Ending around 154.49, down 1.25%. Overall the 2nd lowest volume day since Jan.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend everyone!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 12 3:29PM:</strong></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on track for being the lowest volume day (less than 4.7 million) since before the Jan spike.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 11 2:43PM:</strong></p>
<p>2 hours of low volume lmao. ZZzzzzz. Hopefully we actually get some &ldquo;power&rdquo; during power hour.</p>
<p>Power hour: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6XoLaWv-Js&amp;ab_channel=WardenElite">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6XoLaWv-Js&amp;ab_channel=WardenElite</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6XoLaWv-Js&amp;ab_channel=WardenElite">(wb)</a></p>
<p><strong>Edit 10 11:55AM:</strong></p>
<p>Price is staying above the resistance for the wedge.</p>

<strong>Edit 9 11:50AM:</strong></p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;&gt;</p>
<p>Perhaps midday and power hour, we&rsquo;ll see the fireworks.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 8 11:19AM:</strong></p>
<p>Head and shoulders.</p>
<p><img src="../img/c3jo87mtyjt61.png" alt="">
<strong>Edit 7 11:05AM:</strong></p>
<p>New resistance added at 158.5.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 6 10:47AM:</strong></p>
<p>Moving up on low volume. Nothing significant happening yet.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 5 10:26AM:</strong></p>
<p>Nothing really happening so far. A couple 160 and 200 strike Calls sold. Probably sold to close or covered calls.</p>

<strong>Edit 4 9:51AM:</strong></p>
<p>Bit of a wedge forming.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2 9:37AM:</strong></p>
<p>Bouncing between the 152.5 and 157 channel.</p>
<p><img src="../img/nghqwkjogjt61.png" alt="">
<strong>Edit 1 9:31AM:</strong></p>
<p>First minute candle 192k volume. Pretty low. Perhaps a quiet market open followed by a bang later in the day.</p>
<h1 id="begin-reading-here">Begin Reading Here</h1>
<p>Gooooooood morning my fellow apes!</p>
<p>Well the day has finally come. The great exercise day. By exercise, I mean stand up in your room and stretch your arms. Do some jumping jacks and prepare for whatever the heck GME has in store for us today.</p>
<p><img src="../img/lsmav2yrdjt61.png" alt="">
We saw a bit of a pullback on Thursday, and I&rsquo;m expecting Friday to be a continuation of Wednesday&rsquo;s mad rally. Seems DFV has been on a bit of a tweeting spree recently. Maybe he knows something is up? Getting a bit pumped for what will happen very soon? Who knows. All I know that he knows, is that he really likes the stock. So do I.</p>
<h1 id="premarket-analysis">Premarket Analysis</h1>
<p>Shorts really do love hammering it in the premarket. Broader market gapping up in the premarket but GME hammered down.</p>
