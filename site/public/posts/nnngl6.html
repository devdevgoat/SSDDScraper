<p>Hello fellow Apes and welcome to our third and latest episode of:</p>
<h1 id="who-owns-the-float">&lsquo;Who owns the float?!&rsquo;</h1>
<p>I do not only envy the Nordics for their full viking hair and their beautiful lady apes, but apparently also for their damn hot stock brokers! Why is that?</p>
<p>As we are entering the final stage of <em>&lsquo;hedgies are fuk&rsquo;</em> Nordnet as well as Avanza (both brokers from the Nordics) seem to genuinley care about their customers <em>(yea, take a slice of that, RH and all you other dirtbag brokers)</em> and published their proxy vote stats on <a href="https://twitter.com/avanzabank/status/1397874363056197633">freaking twitter</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210529210727/https://twitter.com/avanzabank/status/1397874363056197633">(wb)</a>. I will save you the click, just see below:</p>

<p>‚Äã</p>
<p><img src="../img/dprsjl2v72271.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Btw: I heard transparency is a thing in the Nordics, is it true that you can just look up your neighbours tax statements or is that just a myth?</p>
<p>However, lets look into the numbers. In my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxrdcb/updated_dd_i_did_the_math_there_is_literally_no/">last post</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxrdcb/updated_dd_i_did_the_math_there_is_literally_no/">(wb)</a> I made some assumptions, and the by far most critical was: How many shares does the average GME investor hold? <strong>Avanza / Nordnet are answering exactly this question.</strong></p>
<p>Quick math:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Broker</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Total GME Apes</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Total Shares held</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Average Shares / Apes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><em>Avanza</em></td>
<td style="text-align:left"><em>22,023</em></td>
<td style="text-align:left"><em>322,545</em></td>
<td style="text-align:left"><em>14.65</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><em>Nordnet</em></td>
<td style="text-align:left"><em>19,206</em></td>
<td style="text-align:left"><em>329,812</em></td>
<td style="text-align:left"><em>17.17</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Total</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>41,229</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>652,357</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>15.82</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>15.82 / Shares per ape. If that doesnt sound juicy, i dont know what does. And even better, it exactly matches with my assumptions from my initial post:</strong></p>
<p><img src="../img/t0o9jy9r72271.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Okay - with the new numbers being fresh in, lets update our sweet little table. I will narrow it to down to 15 / 17.5 / 20 shares per ape. I believe that especially our US apes hold a little more than the Nordics, just for the plain reason that GameStop is more present in the States. (it even appears that GameStop has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/dq2pkm/gamestop_is_closing_all_stores_in_the_nordic/">left the Nordic market completely</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/dq2pkm/gamestop_is_closing_all_stores_in_the_nordic/">(wb)</a>. Any viking ape here to confirm this?).</p>
<p>Please see the updated table below:</p>
<p><img src="../img/uqd99jb1pn271.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Yep, you read that right: 173% up to 230% of remaining float seems to be in retails hand. And as you can see, my list is <strong>by far not complete</strong> (just think of all the regular banks that offer trading accounts).</p>
<p>Just some more hyping:</p>
<p><img src="../img/oc72s0sh72271.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Hold strong my fellow apes, it is the final stage we have entered ! Sorting out the last paper hands before entering lightspeed. And as always: <strong>If in doubt, zoom out</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="../img/iaebf1jg72271.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Have a great weekend, see you on market open, cheers ! üöÄüöÄüöÄ</p>
