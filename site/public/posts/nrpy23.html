			<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of comments from people wondering why shills are working for hedge funds, after reading the DD because it&rsquo;s pretty clear they&rsquo;re going to be out of a job very soon.</p>
<p>I actually put some thought into the situation after this exchange and I believe it&rsquo;s a common misconception. The majority of shills out there on Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube aren&rsquo;t Citadel interns or hired off of LinkedIn.</p>

<h1 id="my-shill-theory">My Shill Theory</h1>
<p>The float is made up of two types of apes:</p>
<p><strong>(a) Apes</strong> - Moral apes, dedicated 100% to bringing down hedge funds.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Apes</strong> - Greedy apes that are willing to either hedge their bets <em>in case</em> MOASS does not happen (<em>oh, it&rsquo;s happening</em>) OR because they know whatever FUD they&rsquo;re told to post isn&rsquo;t going to work and they&rsquo;re double-dipping, perhaps to fund more shares for themselves. There may even be more of these apes than we think, they just simply weren&rsquo;t asked to shill.</p>
<p>The percentage of (b) Apes is a significantly lower percentage overall, but I do believe they exist. After receiving these messages I realized that I DO have this option. Greed is a very powerful influence in the decision-making process. Although the choice I made was the moral one, I do think there are more apes out there than we think that did not make that same choice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet that recruitment and compensation work just like a pyramid scheme.</p>
<p>Below is a reply I received from a shill accidentally breaking character. The DD that I linked wasn&rsquo;t actually DD at all. I spammed r/wallstreetbets with a link to a job description recruiting shills (<a href="https://imgur.com/a/MtkC2ru">here&rsquo;s what was in the link</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210211083054/https://imgur.com/a/MtkC2ru">(wb)</a>) to prove they were among us. I was disguising it because it was when WSB was going through the coup and I didn&rsquo;t want to get blocked.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I&rsquo;ve received 50% downvotes on this post for the first 5-30 minutes. As it gained traction, my upvote percentage went up. Therefore, I suspect that the majority of them came from the hundreds of random users that followed me in the past couple of months. Shills are following top posters to slow down their post traction.</p>
<p><strong>Edit #2:</strong> To all those who think this might be a troll, a couple of apes (u/ceguy86, u/advencik) found the company: <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/04189059">https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/04189059</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210604105912/https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/04189059">(wb)</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think these are trolls. I think the Reddit accounts are fake, most of the info is fake, and they even create the messages to look shiesty, so when apes post this shit calling them out, people will assume it&rsquo;s fake. Troll posts are probably even created in r/GME_meltdown, so shills can just blame them. But if the ape decides to accept the offer and actually goes through with assignments, they probably receive random payments through a random Venmo account or Crypto app so it can&rsquo;t be tracked.</p>
<p>This is the best explanation I can think of. If you&rsquo;re going to cry troll, offer another theory as to where they&rsquo;re all being recruited from. It&rsquo;s crazy we can&rsquo;t pinpoint how they&rsquo;re getting hired considering there are so many of them.</p>
