			<p>After this week and seeing the massive presence of members of the sub, I’ve been keeping track of how many users are online. The peak of this was 197,000 but we’ve been averaging about 150,000 for about two days straight. Today, the number has slowly declined to about 80,000 about 15 minutes ago. All of a sudden it dropped to 24,000 at 11:20PM. It’s safe to say that most likely 100,000 accounts here are either bots or old accounts used by shills to maintain an online presence.</p>
<p>In accordance with other posts regarding this matter, please be prepared for massive FUD and vote manipulation in the next few days/weeks. I’m prepared to sort by new to downvote and report any funny business but it seems that roughly 1/3 of this sub is compromised in some way.</p>
<p>Apes, we’re almost there. Keep them diamond hands.</p>
<p>Edit: people are commenting movie subs have gone down from 40,000 online to 8,000. WSB is down too. I’ve been taking notes of that sub as well and the last I checked (around 10:00PM EST) there was 115,000 online. It’s currently down to 36,000.</p>
<p>Edit 2 (12:14AM EST): To give everyone a rough estimate, between this sub, WSB, amcstock, and GME, roughly 200,000 “users” went offline within 10 minutes of each other.</p>
<p>Edit 3 (12:19 AM EST): we’re back up to over 40,000 online users. Amcstock is back up to 22,000. WSB back to 46,000. Roughly 45,000 “users” just logged back on in less than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Edit 4 (12:22 AM EST): in 3 minutes from my last edit, we just jumped to over 70,000 online users.</p>
<p>Edit 5 (12:37AM EST): I’ll be keeping better statistics of the online activity of this sub and will try to make DD on it this week. If anyone would be willing to PM the exact number of online users at the top of every hour tonight until 8:00AM EST, that would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Edit 6 (12:41 AM EST): Amcstock just shot back up to 32,000 online</p>
<p>Edit 7 (1:09AM EST): For those who suspect its Reddit-wide, I’ve been following the stocks and stockmarket subs for the last hour as well. Stockmarket has remained at 2,250 online and stocks has remained at 7,500 online for the last hour. I find it very suspicious that only the meme stocks are having intense fluctuations of online users in the last two hours. This sub has been subject to the most fluctuation by far with around 50,000 “users” coming back online within ten minutes of each other (time window from 12:14AM EST to 12:22AM EST).</p>
<p>Edit 8 (7:25AM EST): I just want to thank the apes that commented and PMed me times and online user statistics while I was asleep. You all are the realest. I promise I’ll release my results this week with hour by hour information as well as the growth rate of the sub.</p>
<p>Edit 9 (8:29AM EST): changed flair to possible DD. I think it fits the posts more so.</p>
