			<p>*******Edit 3: last edit, my post you‚Äôll see I added incorrectly with tomorrow‚Äôs date NOT being T+21, that would be Friday 4/23! My initial post I had the 3rd squeeze date as 3/24 by mistake, therefore my day prediction is 1 day off. 4/23 would be the next FTD squeeze! ****** I AM THINKING 4/23 WE SEE SOME GREEN DILDOS</p>
<p>*****Edit 3.1: haha damn okay, I‚Äôm seeing a lot of 4/26 being the 21st trading day after&hellip;so in my smooth brain I included the day of the run up in the calculation! Why you ask? Because it makes it work out obviously, if you don‚Äôt none of the days work..so therefore to confirm my bias I did it that way, and it worked. Haha</p>
<p>When lambo you ask? How about tomorrow? ü§Ø</p>
<p>I‚Äôm a little shaken up from this discovery but I‚Äôm excited to bring it to you nonetheless. This runs along side the FTD squeeze DD we seen earlier this year that had the fancy graphs and showed how the coils are tighter and tighter.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve seen more DD pop up the last few days about recognizing patterns in GME trading, things I‚Äôd also noticed but unsure the connection until now (I think)..</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs get some things out of the way, dates don‚Äôt matter, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, and I ate crayons for dinner. I‚Äôll hold until the end of time to bankrupt some Wall Street douche.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs look at some major GME dates for movement shall we?</p>
<p>1/26 +92%</p>
<p>2/24 +103%</p>
<p>3/25 +53%</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt have any shiny graphs or pictures because I‚Äôm on my phone and don‚Äôt know how to attach them ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</p>
<p>What do those days have in common?? 
21 TRADING days apart. You might be saying to yourself ‚Äúbut ape those aren‚Äôt 21 days apart!‚Äù</p>
<p>Let us not forget the NYSE is closed to observe
-Presidents‚Äô Day 2/15 
-Good Friday 4/2
You take those into account and my friends you have 21 days between them EXACTLY.</p>
<p>Want to confirm your ape bias even further, let‚Äôs go back 21 days from 1/26 and look&hellip;oh man 12/28 only +4% guess the theory is out the window&hellip;except the market is closed MLK 1/18 New Year‚Äôs Day 1/1 and back into the 2020 calendar year Christmas Day&hellip;so three trading days behind 12/28?</p>
<p>12/22 +25% and this was before retail really piled on and realized the fuckery behind these shorts.</p>
<p>TL/DR; GME is on a cycle of T-21 micro squeezes and each one makes the starting floor higher and higher. Aka hedgies fucked. üöÄ</p>
<p>The floor is $10,000,000 now Melvin, have Elon put our tendies on the next SpaceX rocket because we‚Äôre gonna be on the moon.</p>
<p>Bonus TA: I‚Äôve noticed big price moves the day after GME ends with really tight daily candles AKA the Doji candle and today‚Äôs is just that. (Have a look at the daily candles on 2/23 and 1/12) Also we‚Äôre sitting comfortably on the 50EMA and MacD is begging to cross! i know TA doesn‚Äôt apply to GME but Algos who pick up buy signals on these TA trends might flock to GME tomorrow giving us the volume we need for another +90% day.</p>
<p>Edit: The 3/25 move would‚Äôve been much larger but the earnings+shorts drove price down a mega fuck ton before hand so the mild increase was hidden behind that. In my opinion</p>
<p>Edit 2/ I know no dates and I‚Äôll get crucified if this is wrong and idc, this is the most fun I‚Äôve ever had in my entire life. This entire GME saga has taught me so much about the market and economy, more than any amount of education. I love making outlandish claims, eventually some shit will stick to the wall and I hope it‚Äôs this Apes‚Äô shits</p>
