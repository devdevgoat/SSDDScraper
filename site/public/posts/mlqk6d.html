has anyone seen the new UPDATED form posted by the DTCC?
FINAL EDIT!!!!: I think we might be wrong on this one. I’m sorry to kill the hype but I am thinking that this has less to do with GME. I’m not 100% sure tho, I would really like to hear from some of the credentialed big brains like u/atobitt and u/rensole. Again I am an ape just like you guys just wanted to get exposure on something that I saw as possibly huge." />

<p>has anyone seen the new <em>UPDATED</em> form posted by the DTCC?</p>
<p>FINAL EDIT!!!!: I think we might be wrong on this one. I’m sorry to kill the hype but I am thinking that this has less to do with GME. I’m not 100% sure tho, I would really like to hear from some of the credentialed big brains like u/atobitt and u/rensole.

<p>A, B, and C seem to be detailing how to basically confirm ownership of a share, and charging a bunch of money until they provide it. PLEASE CAN YOU GUYS TAG BIG BRAIN APES TO HELP!!!!</p>
<p>EDIT: (A) the DTC Crediting Participant hereby agrees that, if the Certificates are not received by DTC’s Underwriting Department by 4:00 p.m. ET on the Closing Date, DTC may debit the Account of the DTC Crediting Participant to the full extent of the Certificates not so received,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Key word here &ldquo;may&rdquo; so still discretion is able to be used and if this debit creates a short position,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the lender doesn&rsquo;t have the shares DTC may charge the settlement account of the DTC Crediting Participant 130% of the current market value</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-we charge you 130%, I assume this covers the share, and a little on top to account for some squeeze of the securities represented by such Certificates until they are received by DTC.</p>
<ul>
<li>You pay a little if they&rsquo;re late a day, if you didn&rsquo;t send anything, we keep hammering you Nothing herein shall affect DTC’s ability to reverse the distribution of the Issue in the event that the Certificates are not received by DTC’s Underwriting Department on the Closing Date;</li>
</ul>
<p>UPDATE: this might only apply to physical shares. Somebody related this to a recent sus event involving physical shares. I’ll update if I find out more.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Here is an explanation by one of our fellow apes u/Repulsive_Impact_651</p>
<p>&quot; it looks like the DTC issued an emergency rider back on march 12th, which is basically just another term for saying this is effective immediately until told otherwise.. that if a share cannot be accounted for, you now have a form you can fill out and you can state why it wasn&rsquo;t accounted for, using one of the couple of legitimate reasons the emergency rider suggests.. basically inability by dtc to accept it, or courier services or down, etc&hellip; the rider says if you legitimately qualify under one of these excuses, then if fill out this form and explain you wont be subject to the 130% short charge on the market value of the failure to deliver you created, since that inhererntly created a naked short position. so basically the DTC is again basically showing they are preparing for a shit storm of FTD&rsquo;s about to come through their system, and it looks like this form in particular is just one of their house chores in preparing for whats about to happen once dtc 2021-005 is implemented. this is dtc way of saying for any of the good guys we want to make sure you arent hurt by our new rule changes <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2020/3/13/13099-20.pdf">https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2020/3/13/13099-20.pdf</a> &quot;</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>&quot; if they dont have the share, they are charge 130%(if its related to a short position) of the value of the share every friday at 4pm EST. If they can&rsquo;t validate they have the share they have to pay up big, imagine 130% of 200 every friday times 1 billion for example. So they will most likely be a massive buying frenzy of GME to account for their shares and ya&hellip;..MOASS. this is big &quot;</p>
<p>EDIT:I am a physics major. Can a financially literate and big brain ape please help me confirm my bias that this is saying what I am understanding it explicitly, and clearly stating?</p>
<p>EDIT2:May be some things wrong here I am saying. Need someone to interpret it please. I don&rsquo;t know why they would release this if it wasn&rsquo;t directly correlated with the counterfeit share situation with GME</p>
<p>EDIT3:Looks like this form was updated today from 2014. Not new. Either way, I believe they updated it in order to use it.</p>
<p>EDIT4:APES I AM BEING TOLD THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SHARES OR GME PLEASE I MIGHT DELETE THIS POST. DO NOT BECOME OVER HYPED</p>
