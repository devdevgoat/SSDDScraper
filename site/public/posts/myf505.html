<p>What I&rsquo;m presenting is 100% based on the publicly available published FINRA OTC data. The way FINRA presents their data makes it really difficult to spot anomalies and trends, so I decided to compile it into an Excel spreadsheet. The trends are clear. The data is revealing. And the Hedgies have some serious wedgies.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>The data is pretty dense. I will try to give an overview of the &ldquo;what&rdquo; and the &ldquo;when&rdquo; and then cover the &ldquo;who&rdquo;. My brain is too smooth to understand the &ldquo;how&rdquo; and the &ldquo;why&rdquo;, so I&rsquo;m hoping that this DD and the supporting data can help other apes unravel the full story.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty easy to track my train of thought. And the fact that I was able to put this together in less than a week really makes me question what&rsquo;s going on with regulators behind the scenes&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>To summarize</strong> - like many of my fellow apes, I was trying to understand this <strong>FINRA ADF</strong> nonsense and why a majority of daily volume was being routed there. All that buying pressure had almost no effect on increasing the price.</p>
<p>Then, I noticed that the calculated volume didn&rsquo;t add up to the daily trading volume on Bloomberg Terminals. There were missing bananas, and I wanted to find them.</p>
<p>After a few adjustments to the search criteria, I was able to see that the bananas weren&rsquo;t necessarily missing, but were not going through any of the exchanges. <strong>Over 90%</strong> of trades from 4/13 - 4/20 were being routed through <strong>FINRA ADF</strong> or some unknown dark pools (<strong>OTC</strong>). That really pissed me off&hellip;</p>
<p>So this weekend, I did some digging on the <a href="https://otctransparency.finra.org/otctransparency/OtcIssueData">OTC website</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210413055232/https://otctransparency.finra.org/otctransparency/OtcissueData">(wb)</a>.</p>

She does a great job digging into the &ldquo;How&rdquo; (with married puts and FTDs). She also does a deep dive into the <strong>ATS data</strong>, which I will only present in passing. Check out her DD!</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Here goes nothing&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start really general and then go into more detail.</p>
<p><strong>Table 1:</strong> <strong>Monthly GME OTC activity</strong></p>
<p><img src="../img/i0g0lwzqn7v61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Not too difficult to spot the trend in this one. The number of shares that were traded OTC increased <strong>4.75x</strong> from December 2020 to January 2021.</p>
<p>The number of OTC trades increased <strong>13.75x</strong> from December 2020 to January 2021.</p>
<p>The number of OTC trades increased <strong>18.42x</strong> from December 2020 to February 2021.</p>
<p>The average size of the trade also has progressively decreased every month, from <strong>over 400 shares/trade</strong> in September to <strong>39 shares/trade</strong> in February.</p>
<p>And just look at the <strong>number</strong> of shares that were traded OTC. Over <strong>525 million</strong> shares traded in January, and over <strong>300 million in February</strong>. To put that in perspective, let&rsquo;s remind ourselves that the GME float is somewhere around <strong>26.7 million</strong> (and quite possibly less).</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the <strong>Weekly GME OTC data</strong> from September 28, 2020 through March 26, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Table 2</strong>: <strong>Weekly GME OTC activity</strong></p>
<p><img src="../img/wykvn3s3hpv61.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Total Weekly GME Shares Traded OTC</p>
<p><img src="../img/z5pnxsw62lv61.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Total Weekly Trades Made OTC</p>
<p><img src="../img/7hse2v9m2lv61.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Average Shares/Trade OTC</p>
<p><img src="../img/3j8upgj03lv61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So back in late September, October, November, December, and even mid-January, the average shares/trade in the OTC market was between <strong>218</strong> and <strong>393</strong> shares/trade.</p>
<p>The number of <strong>OTC trades</strong> for the 15 weeks leading up to January 11th was between <strong>31,712</strong> and <strong>132,438</strong>, with one outlier being the week of 10/5/20. The week of 10/5 had <strong>81.49 million</strong> in OTC volume and <strong>209,031</strong> trades, but still an average of <strong>389.86</strong> shares/trade.</p>
<p>During the week of January 11th, almost <strong>157 million</strong> shares were traded OTC and the number of OTC trades increased almost <strong>3x</strong> that previous outlier, to <strong>588,136</strong> trades.</p>
<p>During the week of January 19th, over <strong>170 million</strong> shares were traded OTC. A new record <strong>849,733</strong> trades were made OTC (<strong>4x</strong> the 10/5 outlier) and the average number of shares/trade dropped to a new low of <strong>200.1</strong> shares/trade.</p>
<p>During the week of January 25th, over <strong>184 million</strong> shares were traded OTC in <strong>4.276 million</strong> trades (<strong>20.45x</strong> the 10/5 outlier) for an average of <strong>43.11</strong> shares/trade.</p>
<p>So things got weird in January. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at that data as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Table 3</strong>: <strong>January GME OTC data by sorted by Trades</strong></p>
<p><img src="../img/tkz5p60sacv61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So this shows us the major players in January. Citadel, Virtu, G1 Execution, Jane Street, and Two Sigma traded the most number of <strong>shares</strong> OTC. You can sort by Shares or Trades, and I&rsquo;m going to be consistent and sort by trades, because I think it&rsquo;s telling to see who was most active.</p>
<p><strong>National Financial Services</strong> (Fidelity???) and <strong>Stockpile Investments</strong> were outliers in terms of shares/trade. Looks like some high frequency trading (HFT) if you ask me. <strong>NFS</strong> first began trading GME OTC during the week of <strong>1/11</strong>/2021 (never previously active from September - December). Stockpile first begin trading OTC during the week of 1/25. I&rsquo;ll leave it there for now.</p>
<p>So <strong>Citadel</strong> traded over <strong>252 million</strong> GME shares in the OTC market in January. They were busy. Based off their 13F filing, how many GME shares did they actually own again? <strong>217,132</strong> shares. In January, they traded <strong>over 1161</strong> GME shares for every <strong>1</strong> share that they own.</p>
<p>What about <strong>Virtu Americas</strong>? They were really active on the OTC market in January too, trading over <strong>136 million</strong> GME shares. As of 12/11/20, they owned exactly 0 GME shares. Luckily for them, they purchased <strong>36,450</strong> as of the 12/31 13F filing. In January, they traded <strong>over 3751</strong> GME shares for every <strong>1</strong> share that they own.</p>
<p>From what I understand, <strong>G1 Execution Services</strong> is basically <strong>Susquehanna</strong>. They decreased their number of GME shares from 4.444 million to <strong>2.487 million</strong> per their 12/31 13F. In January, they traded <strong>30.7</strong> GME shares for every <strong>1</strong> GME share that they own. According to the recent GME proxy, they now own <strong>4.409 million</strong> GME shares, but likely acquired these sometime after January.</p>
<p><strong>Two Sigma</strong> went from <strong>0</strong> GME shares on 11/16/20 to <strong>81,448</strong> GME shares on 12/31. They&rsquo;ve been making smaller and smaller shares/trade for a little while now, with an average of <strong>27.54</strong> shares/trade in January.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s zoom out one more time before looking at each of these players individually.</p>
<p><strong>Table 4</strong>: GME Weekly Volume and % Weekly Volume traded Off-Exchange</p>
<p><img src="../img/5zjj5zvnflv61.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Figure 4</strong>: Weekly % of Float Traded and % of Float Traded Off Exchange</p>
<p><img src="../img/6xdi8ztiglv61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let me preface this by saying that I was extremely conservative and used the <strong>26.7 million</strong> number as the GME float for all calculations. If the GME float is less 26.7 million, these percentages will actually increase accordingly. I took the weekly volume and compared it to the OTC volume and ATS volume. I added the OTC and ATS to determine how much of the weekly volume was traded off exchange. These numbers were fairly consistent, with between <strong>39.88 and 58.39%</strong> of weekly volume trading off exchange in the <strong>OTC</strong> or <strong>ATS</strong> pools. However, the most recent data available shows a huge jump during the week of 3/15, with <strong>68.58%</strong> of volume trading off exchange. These seem to be in line with my calculations from my previous post (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mx4j9p/dark_pool_dd_summary_and_a_quick_update_on_all/">An Update on the Missing GME Bananas</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210423204643/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mx4j9p/dark_pool_dd_summary_and_a_quick_update_on_all/">(wb)</a>), which showed <strong>over 70%</strong> of daily GME volume was being traded via <strong>FINRA ADF</strong> (dark pool), or possibly <strong>OTC</strong> from 4/13 - 4/20. FINRA won&rsquo;t publish that data for another <strong>4 weeks</strong>, but I don&rsquo;t think we even need it anymore. What&rsquo;s missing from the daily totals is traded OTC or ATS. And that percentage is only increasing with less and less weekly volume.</p>
<p>For the next column, I took the weekly volume and divided by <strong>26.7 million</strong> to get the percent of GME float that was traded each week. Over <strong>1000%</strong> of the GME float was traded during the weeks of 1/11, 1/19, 1/25, 2/1, and 2/22. During the week of 1/25, the percent of GME float traded was over <strong>2000%</strong>!</p>
<p>But how much of the GME float was traded off exchange? Well, you see some pretty high numbers during October with over 340% of the float traded off exchange during the week of 10/5 and over 200% of the GME float traded off exchange during the week of 10/12. There are a few weeks when the percentage of float traded off exchange was over 100% (11/30, 12/7, and 12/21). Then comes January&hellip;</p>
<p>During the week of 1/11, over <strong>671%</strong> of the GME float was traded off exchange.</p>
<p>During the week of 1/19, over <strong>746%</strong> of the GME float was traded off exchange.</p>
<p>During the week of 1/25, over <strong>855%</strong> of the GME float was traded off exchange.</p>
<p>During the week of 2/1, over <strong>478%</strong> of the GME float was traded off exchange.</p>
<p>And during the week of 2/22, over <strong>526%</strong> of the GME float was traded off exchange.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to suppress buying pressure&hellip;</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s move on to February</strong></p>
<p><strong>Table 5: February OTC by Number of Trades</strong></p>
<p><img src="../img/ephwq6norcv61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As we saw in <strong>Table 1</strong>, the average number of shares/trade decreased from 90.1 to 39.0. And look who decided to join in on the OTC frenzy - Vlad the Impaler and <strong>Robinhood</strong>.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, this is the first time they took part in the OTC.</p>
<p>They made <strong>772,023 trades</strong> with only <strong>774,632 shares</strong> for an average of <strong>1.00 shares/trade</strong>. That&rsquo;s some high frequency trading if I&rsquo;ve ever seen it. Was it coordinated in a way to crush the price after the January peak?</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t know what to think about National Financial Services (Fidelity?), but the data doesn&rsquo;t lie.</p>
<p>Rather than commenting on each player here, I&rsquo;m going to group them together to see what really happened on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>​</p>
<h1 id="the-kingpins---citadel-and-virtu">The Kingpins - Citadel and Virtu</h1>
<p><strong>Table 6: Citadel and Virtu Weekly OTC trades</strong></p>
<p><img src="../img/v9w1h5abjlv61.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Figure 5</strong>: Virtu and Citadel Weekly OTC Trades</p>
<p><img src="../img/o2p3881ujlv61.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Figure 6</strong>: Virtu and Citadel Average GME Shares/Trade OTC</p>
<p><img src="../img/vi0hrrj8klv61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So these are the two biggest players when it comes to the GME OTC marketplace. Both have been trading a massive number of GME shares and making a massive number of trades since late September.</p>
<p>However, beginning 1/25, both began making much smaller trades. The number of shares per trade decreased from around 300-400 shares/trade to less than 90 shares/trade. The number of trades increased from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands (and even millions).</p>
<p>For <strong>Shitadel</strong>, 7 out of the previous 9 weeks (77.7%) resulted in shares/trade under 60.</p>
<p>They made over <strong>1.98 million</strong> <strong>OTC trades</strong> during the week of <strong>1/25</strong> and over <strong>1.496 million</strong> <strong>OTC trades</strong> during the week of <strong>2/1</strong>.</p>
<p>Prior to January, their previous high for number of trades was <strong>75,652</strong> (10/5).</p>
<p>And a quick reminder, Shitadel, as of 12/31, owned only <strong>217,132</strong> GME shares.</p>
<p>For <strong>Virtu</strong>, 7 out of the previous 9 weeks (77.7%) resulted in shares/trade under 75.</p>
<p>They made over <strong>1.2 million OTC trades</strong> during the week of <strong>1/25</strong>.</p>
<p>Prior to January, their previous high was <strong>67,595 trades</strong> (10/5) and a majority of the weeks totaled between 10,000 and 40,000 OTC trades.</p>
<p>Again, a quick reminder that Virtu owned <strong>0</strong> GME shares on 12/11/20, and <strong>36,450</strong> as of the 12/31.</p>
<p>There are certainly a lot of similarities between these 2 kingpins and that&rsquo;s why I grouped them together. As for coordination???</p>
<p>​</p>
<h1 id="the-middle-men---g1-execution-and-two-sigma">The Middle Men? - G1 Execution and Two Sigma</h1>

<p>​</p>
<p><strong>Figure 7</strong>: G1 Execution and Two Sigma Weekly OTC Trades</p>
<p><img src="../img/l3ehl6tamlv61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t belabor the point, but look at the change in shares/trade (<strong>Table 7</strong>) beginning <strong>1/25</strong>. Look at the increase in number of shares and number of trades.</p>
<p>For <strong>Two Sigma</strong>, the number of shares/trade after 1/25 was never higher than 30.</p>
<p><strong>As a reminder, Two Sigma</strong> went from <strong>0</strong> GME shares on 11/16/20 to <strong>81,448</strong> GME shares on 12/31.</p>
<p>For <strong>G1</strong>, the number of shares/trade after 1/25 was never higher than 60. If <strong>G1 Execution Services</strong> = <strong>Susquehanna</strong>, then they have over <strong>4.409 million</strong> shares.</p>
<p>​</p>
<h1 id="high-frequency-parasites-robinhood-and-national-financial-services-nfs">High Frequency Parasites? Robinhood and National Financial Services (NFS)</h1>
<p><strong>Table 8: Robinhood and NFS Weekly OTC Trading</strong></p>
<p><img src="../img/abbebcv9plv61.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Robinhood</strong> (unfortunately) entered the fray during the week of <strong>2/8</strong>. They have progressively increased their trading activity.</p>
<p>During the week of <strong>2/22</strong>, they made <strong>755,424 trades</strong> with <strong>757,954</strong> of our <strong>GME shares</strong>. They might have been desperately trying to fend off our rapid ascent on <strong>2/24</strong>. The activity slowed during the week of 3/1, before ramping up during the week of <strong>3/8</strong>. Is that significant? Well if we look back to 3/10, we had that massive drop from 348 to 172 in a matter of minutes. So you tell me&hellip;</p>
<p>This one sort of confuses me as a Fidelity customer. <strong>National Financial Services</strong> first entered the OTC marketplace during the week of 1/11. There was a jump in the number of trades during the weeks of 1/25 and 2/1, but the average number of shares/trade remained between 1.02 and 1.00. There was also an increase in OTC trades during the week of 2/22 and 3/8.</p>
<p><strong>Table 9</strong>: Week of 3/8/2021 by Number of OTC Trades</p>
<p><img src="../img/f40ou0486dv61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>During the week when the GME price suddenly dropped from 348 to 172 in a matter of minutes, <strong>Robinhood</strong> was the top OTC trader and had exactly <strong>1.00 shares/trade</strong>&hellip;</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>Table 10:</strong> Week of 3/15/2021 by Number of OTC Trades</p>
<p><img src="../img/27lgobdpbev61.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Robinhood</strong> stepped up again with some serious high frequency OTC trading. Did anything happen that week? Oh yeah, the GME price experienced a huge drop from <strong>280 to 210</strong> on <strong>3/15</strong> and then to around <strong>172</strong> on <strong>3/16.</strong> They didn&rsquo;t switch things up at all from their previous attacks. <strong>297,276 shares</strong> traded <strong>297,194 times</strong> for an average of <strong>1.00 shares/trade.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Table 11</strong>: Week of 3/22/2021 by Number of OTC Trades</p>
<p><img src="../img/p285ecibolv61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And just in case you had any lingering doubts, the data from 3/22 shows us more of the same high frequency OTC trading from Robinhood. <strong>267,095</strong> shares traded <strong>266,981 times</strong> for an average of <strong>1.00 shares/trade</strong>.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Since <strong>Robinhood</strong> entered the OTC marketplace on the week of 2/8/2021, they have made <strong>2.357 million trades</strong> with <strong>2.362 million shares</strong>, for an average of exactly <strong>1.00 shares/trade</strong>. Thanks Robinhood! They are really staying true to their mission of &ldquo;<strong>democratizing finance for all</strong>&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>List of Unanswered Questions:</strong></p>
<p>Was there any significance to the high level of OTC trading during the week of 10/5?</p>
<p>How do all the pieces fit together?</p>
<p>Why did <strong>National Financial Services</strong> (Fidelity?) join the OTC fray in January?</p>
<p>Was the increase in high frequency OTC trading from <strong>Robinhood</strong> during the week of <strong>3/8</strong> in any way related to the massive drop in GME price on <strong>3/10</strong>? What about <strong>3/15</strong> and <strong>3/16</strong>?</p>
<p>What in the actual hell is going on behind the scenes to allow this kind of OTC trading to continue, undisturbed, for almost 3 months?</p>
<p>Who might be willing to do something with this data?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue to update this list.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>As for me - my shares aren&rsquo;t for sale. Seeing the desperate behind-the-scenes OTC shenanigans over the last 3 months only raises the floor. And I really like the stock.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Here is a different way to look at the OTC GME data. It should be abundantly clear that what is going on in the OTC dark pools is extremely abnormal. <strong>Citadel</strong> and <strong>Virtu</strong> market makers seem to be doing a whole lot of OTC trading. How did they get hundreds of millions of shares? What about <strong>Two Sigma</strong>? Why are the same entities trading so much volume so frequently in the OTC marketplace? Why did the number of shares / trade decrease so drastically beginning 1/25? Winter is coming. Are any of them wearing any clothes???</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1</strong>: removed sentence about 13Fs being due on 5/17</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: added the Weekly <strong>3/15 Data</strong> to show that <strong>Robinhood</strong> was highly active again at a time when GME experienced a huge price drop (see Table 10). Thanks u/RecoveryChadX7R !</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: Also, take a look at the DD posted by u/Doom_Douche - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mv5kbm/deep_dive_into_dark_pool_trading_how_they_might/">A Deep Dive into Dark Pool Trading</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210421113939/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mv5kbm/deep_dive_into_dark_pool_trading_how_they_might/">(wb)</a> - which shows the difference between OTC trading for GME vs other stocks. And just note that his data used a GME float of 54.1 million rather than the 26.7 million (or less) that we can now deduce from the updated GME proxy, so the difference is even more pronounced.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 4:</strong> Added some Charts (Figures 1-9) .</p>
<p><strong>Edit 5</strong>: Updated Tables and Figures with 3/22 weekly data</p>
