<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna sit here and tinfoil hat, but c&rsquo;mon they aren&rsquo;t even TRYING to hide they&rsquo;re Bullish on SPY shitting the bed. They&rsquo;re looking to profit when the MOASS fucking destroys the top side of the market. Its so blaringly obvious it hurts.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>ETF&rsquo;s to check as well</p>
<p>TZAFAZSDOWSQQQ</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more I&rsquo;m sure, I&rsquo;ll update this post with more relevant info as I&rsquo;m diving into the rest of these now.</p>
<p>EDIT 1: GME Correlation per Run-up (3 Month Graph)</p>
<p><img src="../img/uba0ffrdayt61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Not a PERFECT 1:1 but you&rsquo;d need to be blind to say there&rsquo;s not something suspect here that deserves more attention.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>EDIT 2: MORE DATAAAAAAAAA WOOOOOHOOOOO</p>
<p>CITADEL FINRA REPORT FOR DECEMBER 31st, 2020 These guys fucking &ldquo;HATE&rdquo; bull runs it seems!</p>

<p>EDIT 4:</p>
<p>JANUARY 11th $SPXS REVERSE STOCK SPLIT</p>
<p><img src="../img/cwr3opgwdyt61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Legit question for the more well versed folk out there. What happens if you are short shares that never existed, then they get combined into 1 share?</p>
<p>The fuck?</p>
<p>Historical values of some of these ETF&rsquo;s prior to 3 separate reverse Stock splits:</p>
<p><img src="../img/99negsd2eyt61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>EDIT 5:</p>
<p>My Brain&hellip; ITS OVERFLOWING:</p>
<p>What if theory:</p>
<p>Inverse ETF&rsquo;s are designed to go DOWN. A Reverse Stock split is a KNOWN quantity to occur.</p>
<p>Hypothetical: If you Naked Short an Inverse ETF (synthetic shares), then you have a Reverse Stock Split happen (10 get combined into 1) in theory you got paid crazy money on a stock that no longer exists due to the nature of these reverse splits.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>LOOK WHAT THIS IS MADE OUT OF:</p>
<p>#1 - THE FUCKING GOVERNMENT (Bank OF New York Cash Reserve is a federal reserve bank)</p>

<p>EDIT 8:</p>

<p>Will update later when I got some time. I think I did good for right now, other Apes are more than welcome to dig into it!</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>EDIT 9:</p>
<p>FUCK I COULDN&rsquo;T HELP MYSELF HERES SOME MORE INVERSE (Bear) ETF&rsquo;s:</p>
<p>ERY:</p>
<p><img src="../img/skoioej86zt61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>TYO:</p>
<p><img src="../img/g8dop2uf6zt61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>TMV:</p>
<p><img src="../img/mvgpialm6zt61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>EDIT 10:</p>
<p>Theory for Reverse Stock Splits on Inverse ETFs, and why the share price from 12 years ago is still alive today:</p>
<p>Consider this:</p>
<p>A reverse stock split on a regular ETF would be exactly that, a 1:2 - &ldquo;Increasing&rdquo; share value.</p>
<p>A regular stock split on a regular ETF would be exactly that, a 2:1 - &ldquo;Decreasing&rdquo; share value.</p>
<p>A reverse stock split on an Inverse ETF = 1:2 &ldquo;Decreasing&rdquo; share value.</p>
<p>A regular stock split on an Inverse ETF = 2:1 &ldquo;Increasing&rdquo; share value.</p>
<p>Remember, this is opposite day with these inverse ETF&rsquo;s. The act of reverse splitting is the same as a regular ETF&rsquo;s stock split, IE - more shares = same money.</p>
<p>Now its simply, Less shares = same money.</p>
<p>Due to how we all know that the ticker is NOT representative of the real price in a manipulated security it is incredibly easy to see how SPXS may be like a bundle of taut cords, about to snap but not readily apparent until it simply happens.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>EDIT 11:</p>
<p>TA;DR -</p>
<p>SPXS goes down, SPY goes up.</p>
<p>SPXS goes up, SPY goes down.</p>
<p>GME correlates with SPXS movements.</p>
<p>If GME goes up, SPXS will go up, and SPY will go down.</p>
<p>Citadel &amp; friends are HYPER Long on SPXS (and other Inverse ETF&rsquo;s) = Profit from GME Mooning. HODL will make all their profits get eaten tho by hungry apes.</p>
