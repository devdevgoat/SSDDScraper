Apes, I would like you to meet Motley Fool Asset Management https://www.mfamfunds.com/index.html (wb), the sister company of the Motley Fool.
This company has several funds and ETFs on their site. So I took a look at the top holdings for each one then did a search on motley fool for their articles to see if they are upholding their mission to help readers obtain financial information and discuss ways to make investment and personal financial decisions (wb) are just a propaganda machine to boost the stock prices of their holdings (spoiler alert: It&rsquo;s the propaganda one)" />

<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- <strong>#1 Holding: Amazon</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon is their number 1 holding in their FOOLX fund</strong> but can be found at some % on most of them**.** And just take a look at the articles. literally they are banging out 3-4 articles A DAY saying how amazing Amazon is</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/1dvetdmbgkt61.png" alt="">
​</p>
<p><strong>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- #2 Holding: Watso Inc.</strong></p>
<p>This is the <strong>number 1 holding in their TMFGX fund.</strong> I had never heard of this company, but motley fool has over 100 articles about it and once again all singing its praises.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/u7jcbrvtgkt61.png" alt="">
<strong>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- #3 Holding - Apple</strong></p>
<p>Apple is their <strong>number 1 holding in their motley fool 100 ETF (TMFC)</strong> and they actually <strong>wrote some negative articles</strong> about them&hellip; <strong>just kidding!</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/sq41ovmhhkt61.png" alt="">
<strong>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- GME</strong></p>
<p>AAAAANNNNDDD now let&rsquo;s get to GME:</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/rhn78akyhkt61.png" alt="">
<img src="../img/7brwqb47ikt61.png" alt="">
As you can see, not so great. They even did some comparisons between amazon, i wonder what they suggested&hellip;</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/lfxkxsbpikt61.png" alt="">
<strong>Now some of you may &ldquo;wait, this seems like blatant market manipulation?&rdquo; and if this was a just world then answer would be DUH!!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>BUTTTTT, at the bottom of their articles, they disclose that they do have a position in the stock (and even their call option recommendations&hellip;), its just in size 5 font after another long disclaimer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So at least they are nice enough to let you know they are manipulating you if you bother to read the fine print.</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/2b6r3y0zbmt61.png" alt="">
<strong>Update:</strong> so i clicked on their disclosure policy <a href="https://www.fool.com/legal/fool-disclosure-policy/">https://www.fool.com/legal/fool-disclosure-policy/</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141254/https://www.fool.com/legal/fool-disclosure-policy/">(wb)</a> and found this GEM:</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/xpwt5n3i9mt61.png" alt="">
and also this from their disclaimer page <a href="https://www.fool.com/legal/the-motley-fool-disclaimer/">https://www.fool.com/legal/the-motley-fool-disclaimer/</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210126110256/https://www.fool.com/legal/the-motley-fool-disclaimer/">(wb)</a></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/r2p46pqaamt61.png" alt="">
<strong>So funny that they say that they are not here to give you buy or sell recommendations when they literally say &ldquo;Recommends Apple. The Motley Fool recommends the following options&hellip;&quot;</strong></p>
<h1 id="so-if-you-had-any-doubt-about-the-purpose-of-motley-fool-it-is-just-propaganda-to-prop-up-their-holdings-and-downplay-any-other-company-that-could-threaten-them">So if you had any doubt about the purpose of motley fool, it is just propaganda to prop up their holdings and downplay any other company that could threaten them.</h1>
