<p><strong>TLDR: Today was the lowest volume trading day since Tuesday January 12 (when the price $19.95)! Historically we have seen huge volume trading days (and big price gains) on the Wednesday and guess what tomorrow is???💎✋🚀🚀🚀</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: I am not suggesting that it will moon tomorrow, just that we could see a good spike in volume and price.</strong></p>

<p>Below is the data for GME from Jan 4 to April 6:</p>

I bolded the days with significantly low volume before we then saw huge volume days.</p>
<p>The first was <strong>Tuesday Jan 12</strong> with only 7m vol. On <strong>Wednesday</strong>, we saw 144m vol and 57% increase in price</p>
<p>The second time was <strong>Tuesday Feb 23</strong> with only 7.5m vol. On <strong>Wednesday</strong> we saw 83m vol and 104% price increase</p>
<p>Today, <strong>Tuesday April 6</strong> we saw 6m in vol. <strong>What will we see tomorrow???</strong></p>
<p>Also interesting to note, it was <strong>27 trading days between the first two low volume days</strong>, and <strong>28 days between the second and today,</strong> this almost sounds like <strong>a trend&hellip;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- Available Shares to borrow</strong></p>
<p>Another interesting note, today we saw a <strong>huge increase in the availability of shares to borrow</strong> (from 80k to 950k) through <a href="https://iborrowdesk.com">iborrowdesk.com</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210406192420/https://iborrowdesk.com/">(wb)</a>.</p>
<p>You can also see that a sharp <strong>increase in the number of shares available to borrow</strong> also happened on <strong>Feb 23rd</strong>, increasing by <strong>900,000 in 1 day</strong>&hellip; <strong>how many did it go up by today?</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- TLDR</strong></p>
<p><strong>TLDR: Today was the lowest volume trading day since Tuesday January 12 (when the price $19.95)! Historically we have seen huge volume trading days (and big price gains) on the next day (Wednesday) after a low volume Tuesday. What will tomorrow bring???💎✋🚀🚀🚀</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: I am not suggesting that it will moon tomorrow, just that we could see a good spike in volume and price.</strong></p>
