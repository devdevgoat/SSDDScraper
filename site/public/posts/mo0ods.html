They&rsquo;re not reporting 49% loss on the short position itself.
Because like they say you dont lose til you sell. And if they covered, they&rsquo;d have lost a lot more. The number 49% makes no sense to me as a short position loss the more I think about it. Because it would bankrupt them. They&rsquo;d be -1000% not -49%
This occurred to me battling shills. So thank you shills." />

<p>They&rsquo;re not reporting 49% loss on the short position itself.</p>
<p>Because like they say you dont lose til you sell. And if they covered, they&rsquo;d have lost a lot more. The number 49% makes no sense to me as a short position loss the more I think about it. Because it would bankrupt them. They&rsquo;d be -1000% not -49%</p>
<p>This occurred to me battling shills. So thank you shills. Once again you fucked yourselves up by not giving up üòÇ</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re reporting a cash loss.</p>
<p>The cash loss is the interest fees on the short position&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>They lost 49% on the INTEREST FEES ALONE.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my theory. Does it make sense?</p>
<p>Edit: anonymous all seeing eye award. Someone sees the Deep Fucking Value of this theory.</p>
