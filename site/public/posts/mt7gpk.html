<p>On Google Maps it appears there was activity (and a lot, simply a few phones wouldn&rsquo;t have triggered Google to say there was activity at the HQ) at Citadel&rsquo;s HQ after hours.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Cryptocurrencies just took a MASSIVE dump</strong>. Something crypto has NEVER seen before. Crypto is volatile, but this was unprecedented. I&rsquo;ve been in crypto since 2017 and never seen anything like this. Bitcoin dumped from $59,000 to $51,000 in less than 20 minutes.</p>
<p><em>[[<em><strong>INLINE EDIT</strong></em>: cryptocurrency dump may be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mt6cq5/ok_so_this_is_the_reason_for_the_dip/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">unrelated</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210418101602/https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mt6cq5/ok_so_this_is_the_reason_for_the_dip/">(wb)</a> BUT</em> <em>that doesn&rsquo;t matter</em>*. If the Tweet is accurate, we can almost be sure that explains why there is currently activity at Citadel HQ. Check my final edit, there&rsquo;s insane activity at Citadel HQ right now.]]*</p>
<hr>
<p>The timing of this Tweet AND CITADEL HQ ACTIVITY confirms to me that these 2 events are definitely related, and brings validity to these rumours.</p>
<p>I think HUGE news is about to drop boys. These charges will be very, very fucking interesting.</p>
<p>Explained GME to a couple of my family members and showed them some DDs like the everything short and we are buying in again on Monday (especially because DFV doubled down, I regret not doubling down with him before and now he has given us the opportunity again). I&rsquo;m an XXX holder from late last year and I&rsquo;m not selling until I make at least $100,000,000 from this. The global economy is about to crash and GME is our hedge against it.</p>
<p>Load up on tendies autists, this week might be insane.</p>
<p>edit: added Google Maps link to Citadel HQ.</p>
<p>edit 2: HOLY FUCK. <strong>THEY ARE STILL AT CITADEL HQ</strong>. I just realised the RED BAR is the LIVE activity. It literally shows the CURRENT activity. <a href="img/imgur_H4GBOBD.pn.gif">LOOK AT THIS SCREENSHOT.</a> It shows there is STILL people at Citadel HQ. It&rsquo;s 1AM in Chicago. They have been there SINCE the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt4j8w/shitadel_hq_oddly_busy_right_now_on_a_weekend/">last post</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210418141413/https://i.redd.it/a55n3cqzgut61.jpg">(wb)</a> which was made 3-4 hours ago.</p>
<p>edit 3: Someone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt6rop/kenny_and_the_boys_working_late_on_saturday_huh/">got a picture of the lights on</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210418140114/https://i.redd.it/rey626tu9vt61.jpg">(wb)</a> in their HQ. Easy raid or employees shredding docs? <a href="img/imgur_HxMpmYh.jp.gif">Here is another picture of the lights on from less than 20 minutes ago</a>.</p>
<p>edit 4: WHAT THE FUCK! <a href="img/imgur_jL7NtGK.pn.gif">THERE IS MORE ACTIVITY AT CITADEL HQ RIGHT NOW AT 2 AM THAN THE PEAK ACTIVITY IS EVER DURING THE ENTIRE DAY FOR SATURDAY</a></p>
<p>edit 5: removed a paragraph talking about the cryptocurrency dump because it&rsquo;s UNRELATED. There is CRAZY activity at Citadel HQ right now, and if the Tweet is real it might be related</p>
