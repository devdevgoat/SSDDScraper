<p>Addendum— these lawsuits are mentioned in an upcoming merger- lawsuits related to the debacle fall out from GME in January - the reason I think it’s a positive thing is the merging brokerage must disclose and they state an increase of awareness of market manipulation and this makes them more liable and also more apt to regard Sec laws. 
Also it provides more info to help us know the bigger picture. I think this is all GOOD- there will be more eyes and more regulation. I personally am not changing my broker. Just personal opinion and absolutely not financial advice. I’m a silly ape who doesn’t know anything.</p>
<p>*Note I only had time to start perusing it&ndash; I think this document is a great filing that can help gather more info. Just putting it out there for all the other ape nerds like myself that like to research&ndash; I appreciate you all as all of us that play by the rules need to see the bigger picture to stop allowing the bigger parties to make their own rules.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Part of merger goes into detail about APEX lawsuits and &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo;&ndash;</p>
<p>&quot; Plaintiffs allege that Apex, along with over 30 other brokerages, trading firms and/or clearing firms, including Morgan Stanley, E*Trade, Interactive Brokers, Charles Schwab, Robinhood, Barclays, Citadel and DTCC engaged in a coordinated conspiracy in violation of anti-trust laws to prevent retail customers from operating and trading freely in a conspiracy to allow certain of the other defendants, primarily hedge funds, to stop losing money on short sale positions in GameStop, AMC and certain other securities. &quot;</p>
<p>Engaging in unfair competition</p>
<p>&quot; Apex Pro, ETC Processing Technologies LLC and ETC Global Holdings, Inc. (collectively, the “<em>ETC Defendants</em>”) are defendants in the matter captioned as InteliClear, LLC v ETC Global Holdings, Inc., et al., filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the “<em>District Court</em>”) in 2018. The plaintiff in this matter alleges that the ETC Defendants misappropriated trade secrets under the Defend Trade Secrets Act and California Uniform Trade Secrets Act, breached a contract with plaintiff and engaged in unfair competition. &quot;</p>
<p>Please disregard my spelling errors in title- my
iPad wasn’t the ideal typing platform and I’m horrified I cannot edit it. <em>ashamed ape</em></p>
<p><em>cheers my beautiful apes</em></p>
