We aim to vote at 100% of meetings where our clients have given us authority to vote their shares, and therefore vote at approximately 16,000 shareholder meetings in approximately 85 markets each year. With regards to non-U.S. holdings, generally we estimate that we vote successfully at approximately 90% of meetings. Of the remaining, 8% are not voted due to shareblocking and 2% are not voted due to either the fund’s leverage, impediments such as ballots received post cut-off date or post meeting date, or other restrictions like in-person attendance or power of attorney being required in order to vote." />
