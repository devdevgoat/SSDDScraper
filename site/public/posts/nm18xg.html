<p>This is worth playing around with. But, when you do, you will come to the conclusion that this has been going on a long time, and has been predatory and systematic in nature.</p>
<p>GME is an outlier in these 2,287 trading days GME has had FTD&rsquo;s on 2,014 of them, so everyday except 273 trading days that&rsquo;s roughly 9 out of 10, well I sure all stocks have that right since they make it seem so trivial and just a case of happenstance.</p>
<p>Well in those 2,287 trading days there were a total of 36,839 tickers traded, that has us coming in at a incredible ranking of #17 they probably all have something similar to that going on&hellip; right?! WRONG the bar chart distribution graph on the bottom shows you how many tickers have had fails on, how many days during this period. Well GME&rsquo;s stats just like our rocket is out of this world the number 2,014 isn&rsquo;t even displayed it&rsquo;s so high. GME is in the 99.999% percentile of the most consistently failed to deliver stock on the market for the last 10 YEARS!!</p>
<p>For some kicks lets compare it to a stock like AAPL that&rsquo;s a blue chip stock with Billions of shares with all of that trading there&rsquo;s gotta be some trivial happenstance type stances happening trivially there too right. It&rsquo;s had fails on 1931 days a stock with 16.7 Billion shares outstanding so many shares they don&rsquo;t even round down to GME&rsquo;s shares in existence. Average volume of nearly a 100 million shares, and there numbers aren&rsquo;t near GME&rsquo;s think about that.</p>
<p>Go ahead and look at TSLA&rsquo;s the just went through a short squeeze correct, I feel like that&rsquo;s more of an upset stomach, while more consistently failed, the number of fails is nowhere near GME&rsquo;s and their shares outstanding are over 950 Million.</p>
<p>Closely ranked in the top 10 also are the two ETF&rsquo;s that contain GME that have been borrowed to hell XRT and IWM.</p>

For full context GME paid a quarterly dividend up until March of 2019, which would make it less attractive to short, but you know that wasn&rsquo;t stopping them completely. Jim Bell the canned CFO who they wanted out of there so bad, they gave him &ldquo;Good Reason&rdquo; and he collected a 2.8 Million dollar bonus, that was to get him out a whole 4 months early. He was hired in June 2019, and you can&rsquo;t make me believe that he wasn&rsquo;t Steve Cohen, Gabe Plotkin, Virtu, Susquehanna, Citadel&rsquo;s man on the inside. It isn&rsquo;t these guys MO to throw a dart at a board they like to have an inside scoop. He had already ran Coldwater Creek down, a stint at Red Lion Hotels then sunk PF Changs before Gamestop, and he&rsquo;s currently at Backcountry in Park City, Utah. I wonder how those interviews go, so&hellip; how many of your former employers are out of business CFO dickhead?</p>
<p>We also, know how many FTD&rsquo;s they have had to conceal through married puts.</p>
<p>I want to take a little Poll how many shares real and counterfeit do you think exist?</p>
<p>Price is wrong style, closest without going under in the comments</p>
