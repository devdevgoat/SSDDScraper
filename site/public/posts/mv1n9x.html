For people saying that there was a reverse split and that is not a good exemple. Can you provide your source stating this happening in august 2020? The only reverse split I see was in 2018 and thus is irrelevant. The price which shoot from $125 to $25&#39;000 is still a &ldquo;true price&rdquo;
I saw this post saying the fact:

<p>Why the hell the post above didn&rsquo;t moon? Here&rsquo;s three articles explaining about DGAZF&rsquo;s short squeeze:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>In the second article, you can also see that one of the holders was shitadel advisors LLC&hellip; credit to u/Alternative_Court542</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> the ETN stock had a 45% short interest and 140'000 shares shorted (only that amount? strange isn&rsquo;t it? Some wrinkly ape to check all this please?). So it went from $400 to $25,000. Do I need to remind you what situation is GME in? Spoiler: Much much much more shorted lol.</p>
<p>Edit2: YES I FOUND A <strong>CHART</strong> ABOUT THE SQUEEZE</p>
<ul>

<p>It seems that there was no dip during the squeeze but I could only take a look with a 45 minutes scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5 minutes scale</strong>! Thank you u/majordanage Indead, there is one little dip before $25'000 that you could avoid by looking at the stoch RSI which was <strong>still</strong> being near 80.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../img/ib6asgfbliu61.jpg" alt="">
Edit4: Yes of course not every share sold for $25'000 sadly, so you juste have to hold even more. Only a few will get the max share&rsquo;s price&hellip; It is those who have diamond hands surely</p>
<p>Edit5: u/BeansMostly said something very interesting about the float. Take a look at the quote just below. Of course don&rsquo;t forget that we may own many many times the float which would ease the problem of having 70 millions shares instead of the 300k shares of DGAFZ.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>There are 140k shares shorted in the ETN</em></p>
<p>Which according to the table in the article is ~46% of the float.</p>
<p>So there were ~300k shares total in the float.</p>
<p>It is much easier to control 300k shares than it is to control 70m. The number of players would be much smaller and encouraging continued holding would be much easier.</p>
<p>This <em>does</em> show that it&rsquo;s possible though.</p>
<p>Of course, it later states it had an average daily volume of only 8k shares. Their time to cover would have been astronomical compared to GME.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize the things that make a scenario not work. That&rsquo;s how science gets done.</p>
<p>That being said: look at that, a 25k squeeze. Nice.</p>
<p>Edit: this is all based on the first non-reddit link in your post</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit3: I don&rsquo;t know if it is illegal to ask this but can you also upvote the crosspost on r/GME ? It would be cool if everyone get to see this&hellip;</p>
