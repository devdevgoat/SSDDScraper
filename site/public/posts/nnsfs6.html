			<p>************ I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice ************</p>
<p>Apes, I&rsquo;ve recently gotten into comedy and wanted to test out some of my jokes on you:</p>
<p>Why did the chicken cross the road? Because my wife is fucking the mailman.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between GME and my wife? GME doesn&rsquo;t have four boyfriends.</p>
<p>How many HFs does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Seriously guys my wife is a cheating whore.</p>
<p>What happens after you eat five bags of flaming hot cheetos? <strong>You take a dump.</strong></p>
<p>And that brings me to my next point. DUMP. Yes, apes, this will be yet another DD dump. No main purpose or direction, just a few DD theories from your favorite guncle Hank. As always this is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.</p>
<p><img src="../img/j62o5z1nd3271.png" alt=""></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>FTD cycle update</strong></p>
<p>Alright everyone, so the FTD cycle theory was correct again for this period. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know/remember, this theory says that because of SEC FTD regulations, there is a predictable price and volume spilke every 21 trading days or 35 calendar days with about a +/- one day margin of error. If you look at the FTD cycle since september when it was only $10, the price each cycle is increasing exponentially as it is now over $200, which means that it is getting more and more expensive to stay in this game. Not gonna spend much time on this because I&rsquo;ve covered it tons in my past DDs and many other apes are also getting into smaller FTD cycle research (which I love):</p>
<p><img src="../img/zfcmkgu0e3271.png" alt="">
In my opinion, this shows us something very important. First, it shows us that it is getting exponentially more expensive to stay in this game and that there should be a breaking point soon. Second, it shows that the media narrative that retail is the reason for this run up is flat out wrong. IMO retail stopped mass-buying GME in late January and has simply held and bought small amounts since then. This right now is all about institutions being forced to cover because retail continues to hold. It makes absolutely no sense that retail is just randomly deciding to buy GME in mass on absolutely no news every 21 trading days. This narrative makes sense because then they can blame us when it all blows up.</p>
<p><img src="../img/z68ruuskh3271.png" alt="">
<strong>Midday spikes</strong></p>
<p>Apes, this has been one of the most baffling things for me to research and it has taken a ridiculously long amount of time. As I&rsquo;ve explained, I have noticed that GME has these midday spikes in positive volume and price. Here are the requisites for those spikes:</p>
<ol>
<li>They occur between 11am - 2:30pm (any times before or after that cannot be counted becuase it could be due to early market high volumes or power hour volumes)</li>
<li>They are the highest, second highest, or third highest single minute volume candles for the whole day (usually the highest)</li>
<li>They occur on no news and preceeding and proceeding candles are always significantly lower than them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an example of one:</p>
<p><img src="../img/lf7an2osz2271.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is an example of one that <strong>IS NOT</strong> one of these spikes:</p>
<p><img src="../img/83uq0evwz2271.png" alt=""></p>
<p>IMO it would be far too dificult to document literally every single one of these and run some data comparisons on it. However, after looking at many of these, here are my observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>This DOES NOT happen to normal stocks, this is extremely weird</li>
<li>This DOES happen to stocks like AMC, EXPR, NOK, etc. but happens less frequently</li>
<li>These midday volume spikes have picked up drastically post-squeeze</li>
<li>The spikes also started to pick up after GME hit $10 in October 2020</li>
<li>The spikes increased progressively more throughout 2020 and up to the squeeze</li>
<li>The spikes have been going on since 2018ish and have been increasing more and more</li>
<li>The spike sometimes happen for a few days in a row but never more than three days in a row</li>
<li>There is typically a 1-4 day break in between spikes but never more than 5 days</li>
<li>The volume of these spikes (not price) has increased pretty regularly since 2020 but not consistently</li>
</ol>
<p>What do I take away from all of this? I said in my last post that I think they are covering during these times. That would make sense because 11-2:30 is usually the lowest volume of the trading day, so they want to cover when they can be positive that a HFT wont swoop in and screw them over on the price. They also don&rsquo;t want their trades to give the stock momentum during high volume times because that could cause a price spike.</p>
<p>If you all rememeber that big beautiful FTD squeeze DD doc (I think it&rsquo;s from this website <a href="https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/DD/GME/og/GMEv14.pdf">https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/DD/GME/og/GMEv14.pdf</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210410091945/https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/DD/GME/og/GMEv14.pdf">(wb)</a> which is now defunct) they say that the GME shorting likely happened in 2017 or 2018 when they took on some debt and it was likely that they would default in 2020. Why did these midday spikes start increasing more in 2020? I&rsquo;m guessing that the shorts piled on more naked shorts between March-May (when GME hit its all time lows) because they thought that it was going to go bankrupt because of covid. Once it got above $10, their positions got more and more expensive, so these midday FTD covers happened more and more. Now these midday covers seem like a mainstay, which IMO indicates that they are indeed fucked in their short positions.</p>
<p>Sadly, there is far too much data for me to codify and find significance; however, I have done enough observations that I&rsquo;m pretty confident my above findings are correct. So IMO, it appears that this is what we are looking at in terms of the FTD cycle:</p>
<p><img src="../img/642523aw23271.png" alt="">
So within our giant 21 day FTD cycle we have these other cycle occuring as well (the smaller the shape, the more frequently it happens, but the more frequently it happens the smaller and less noticable it is). Again this is just a theory / my opinion but what this means is that because the shorts have such a giant short position that&rsquo;s too big for them to unravel (they financially cannot do it), there are predictable days and times where they have to cover based on SEC regulations. Now, this is not an invitation to try to predict these times and profit off of them, that&rsquo;s stupid and will probably lose you money (not financial advice). However, the fact that some retard named hank can find this simply by using trading chart patterns, a calendar, and SEC rules, shows that they are indeed in too deep.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best part about all of this? Well, it&rsquo;s increasing at an exponential rate meaning it&rsquo;s getting exponentially more and more expensive for them to keep this shit up (see one of my previous posts for proof of exponential increase as this recent FTD cycle increase only adds to that). AGAIN, this, unlike my other FTD posts, is not based on concrete data, it is based on my observations when doing back testing. However, because I did many hours of back testing, I am confident that these observations are accurate. If someone does some kind of data collection on this, WOW you really are a god becuase that would be the most time consuming thing ever, but I think that based on what I&rsquo;ve observed, my findings are correct.</p>
<p>One genius-retard, u/startanks, sent me this message a week ago and it has been giving me wet dreams ever since:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Current regulations forces market makers to have their net capital requirements positive, which they check once a day at 1pm est. Therefore it is most likely shorts, as you said, buying back stock so their net cspital stays positive for the day. This is what dtcc-002 is trying to change. To add to your discussion of the spikes around 2pm everyday - Reverse Repos have same day maturity date that closes ~1:15-2pm everyday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, IMO, is fucking genius and gives even more credence to the DD coming out of this sub about the repo market. Apes, I have been a bull my entire life. I legit drink bull semen. But holy fuck, this market is making me a 🌈🐻. IMO, the market is over-leveraged, the market is pricing things like the recovery happened 6 months ago, banks and institutions did some shady-overleveraged shit with the SLR releif and other easings of restrictions during covid, inflation is likely to happen, the repo market is absolutely fucked, etc. etc. etc. I could literally write a giant DD on why I think that there is going to be a serious correction soon (not financial advice) - don&rsquo;t ask me to do this though - I am focused on GME and nothing else. I think this is why Burry shorted TSLA. I think that he has the same thesis as I do, but he thought that growth stocks would be hit the hardest during a correction. So his bet against TSLA is really just a bet against the market that uses TSLA as further leverage. If the market corrects it is likely that HFs will be forced to liquidate their GME positions. Like I said in my other post, we should not be praying for a market crash because that destroys lives. Instead, we should be grateful for the fact that we seem to have found a way to profit off of it at the expense of those who created it. Does GME benefit from a market correction or does it cause a market correction? Who knows.</p>

<p><strong>Earnings and annual meeting</strong></p>
<p>You might have noticed that the very first chart in this post shows a consolidation pattern (red lines) that converge on earnings. I also covered this in a previous post. It appears that we have broken that trend. IMO, as I said in my post recent post, there is a good chance that this was simply to make apes think that the squeeze is over so that we sell before the annual meeting. IMO, I think that the annual meeting will be a slam fucking dunk. It will probably be the start of the squeeze (i.e. the catalyst that gets it going) but will probably not be the squeeze itself. Essentially, the annual meeting, IMO, will show us whether the MOASS will be a January-style squeeze (rapid and short) or a TSLA-type squeeze (slow and long).</p>
<p>The reason I think it will be the start is because of the lack of information that we&rsquo;ve been given about GME from leadership in the past few weeks and their incentive to have a good meeting. We&rsquo;ve seen teasers (NFT thing) and RC tweets (btw there&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind that he reads through GME reddit posts and is on our side because you don&rsquo;t tweet like that if you&rsquo;re not. He&rsquo;s just being vague so he doesn&rsquo;t get investigated) that all point to a huge announcement. Could it be a CEO, a crypto dividend, notice that there are more votes than shares, NFT stuff, etc.? Either way, I think there will be an announcement there that kicks off the squeeze. More importantly, I think that it will gives whales a good entry point. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<p>I am going to use the example of George Soros' genius British pound trade (you can watch literally a billion Youtube videos on this). George soros made one of the greatest trades in history by shorting the British Pound. Essentially, he saw the British Central Bank doing dumb things that were going to devaule the currency and he saw technical weakness as well. He knew he was going to do this trade and knew why, however, he first needed some kind of news event or catalyst so that he could enter the trade so that others would join in. Essentially, Soros took a huge short position after some only slightly negative news about the Pound and it tanked. This made the rest of the market think that everyone was bearish, so it created a panic (after hours I may add so the volume was easily affected). People didn&rsquo;t realize that it was just one man doing this until it was far too late. (This is a metaphor for what I believe will happen to GME, George Soros is not involved in GME in any way - do not put your tin foil hat on).</p>
<p>I theorize that there is a long whale or several long whales waiting to pounce on GME for this exact reason. Whoever they are they have been consolidating GME&rsquo;s price for the past few months. I don&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s to lower IV anymore to set up a gamma squeeze. I know fully believe that whoever is doing this is trying to tame GME&rsquo;s price and will then pounce on it once there is appropriate news. Why? If the long whale just did this on no news the market wouldn&rsquo;t pounce on and be like &ldquo;oh shit positive news, market loves GME&rdquo; it would just be like &ldquo;oh great more gamestop shit, it&rsquo;s retail again and it&rsquo;s gonna go away, I&rsquo;m not getting in on this.&rdquo; Instead, if there&rsquo;s news and an influx of buying, the market might perceive that as &ldquo;oh shit this news was way better than I thought I gotta get in. This is actually a fundamentally good opportunity.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t matter if this is short or long term buying because once the price gets sufficiently high, the shorts get a call from marge. Again, this is all just a theory. However, RC tweet seems to confirm this as it says its coming back from the dead</p>
<p>If you have FUD, I would direct you to see my previous posts where I address FUD, but just to add some more. Remember all of the things that aren&rsquo;t normal about GME. Remember that DFV doubled down. Remember that we have more evidence of a squeeze happening than the people pre January did&hellip; and they didn&rsquo;t have a previous squeeze to compare to. Imagine how crazy people mustve thought they sounded, &ldquo;you think it&rsquo;s gonna squeeze past $300? yeah ok.&rdquo; Then it happened. If they can hold with less evidence, fewer apes, and no previous squeeze to compare to, then yeah I FUCKING CAN TOO. (Not financial advice).</p>

<strong>Crypto and the FTD cycle</strong></p>
<p>A few sexy apes have sent me some messages about crypto and GME. At first I thought this was bullshit but after doing some research, there seems to be something there. Every single FTD cycle is the lowest point that BTC gets (i.e. it decreases up to that day but doesn&rsquo;t decrease on that actual day by much then it goes back up). This got me thinking more about crypto and GME. Just like with GME&rsquo;s FTD cycle, when you see a repeating pattern like this in BTC (especially because it&rsquo;s so unregulated and easily manipulated) it&rsquo;s probably not a coincidence. What I think could be going on is that shorts are storing liquid cash in BTC in an attempt to hide their cash positions for disclosure/filing purposes. They are then liquidating those positions in the days preceeding the FTD cycle so they can pay for it. Notice how BTC climbs up the next few days after every FTD cycle? I still think there&rsquo;s something more going on here, however, because IMO it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to store cash in such a volatile asset, so if anyone has more ideas please send them my way:</p>
<p><img src="../img/5jrxoslbw2271.png" alt="">
Sorry about all the crazy dots and stuff those are my tard indicators. The red lines are FTD cycle days. Notice how there isn&rsquo;t a discerable up or down day on those dates. However, before each of those dates, BTC drops precipitously a few days prior. Like I said, that makes me think that HFs are storing capital in BTC (for whatever reason) and are liquidating it a few days prior to pay for the FTD cycle. Why was this recent BTC drop particularly bad? Well, it&rsquo;s because this FTD cycle was extremely more expensive AND there was horrible BTC news (elon tweets and investigations for one of the exchanges). Again, I think there&rsquo;s something else that I&rsquo;m missing here, so if anyone has any ideas please send them my way or make your own DD!</p>
<p>Here is perhaps the most interesting thing that I&rsquo;ve seen all week. A genius-retard by the name of u/pleasantlyunbothered (great name btw) sent me some information on a unique type of crypto that may have some relation to GME. This ape brought to my attention something called Saffron Finance, which &ldquo;is designed to pool lioquidity to ease pressure off of over leveraged investors.&rdquo; So, I went on it&rsquo;s chart and marked the FTD cycle dates and circled days where GME had significant price dips:</p>
<p><img src="../img/5hprzpt2a3271.png" alt="">
It&rsquo;s not entirely clear if there is a correlation; however, it seems obvious, IMO that this concept (a place to ease liquidity troubles for overleveraged investors) could be a safe-haven for someone trying to hide a short position or hide capital to be used for short attacks. I am not saying anything definitive here and definitely need to do more research on this coin but it is something interesting to think about and again excellent find by the user who sent this to me.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>AMC</strong></p>
<p>I am now going to adress AMC. I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of talk on here about how AMC is a distrction from GME or how anyone talking about AMC is a shill or how AMC is a HF ploy. What I&rsquo;m about to say may make some of you mad but it needs to be said: stop fucking saying that because it&rsquo;s untrue, it makes us look jealous, it divides retail, and it makes us look like conspiracy theorists. Before I go further, let me first say that I have no position in AMC and am all in on GME. I think that GME is the better stock and has millions of times more potential than AMC.</p>
<p>If you look at my previous post where I discuss how there&rsquo;s a group of stocks that all have a similar pattern to GME (AMC, NOK, EXPR, KOSS, etc.), you will see that AMC is one of them. These stocks have a remarkably similar pattern and all seem to have started around may 2020. In that post, I go into how I think that HFs shorted all of these in concert because they expect covid to destroy them. When the market picked up, they got shafted on these bets, so they unravelled together. I said that GME was probably shorted the most and the best news happened to it, so that&rsquo;s why it shot up the most. Moreover, it is impossible for someone to be able to make a series of stocks behave in the exact same pattern for such a long period of time - it is the result of them being similarly shorted and SEC rules requiring similar coverages. Moreover, it makes absolutely no sense for a fund to pump up a stock that is already heavily shorted for the purpose of distracting from GME. Why would they spend their money on that when they could just short GME? It&rsquo;s clearly the result of an FTD cycle similar to GME (I mean GME did rise pretty significantly this week as well).</p>
<p>The thing that I keep seeing are these posts on days that AMC rises more than GME saying &ldquo;if you talk about AMC, I&rsquo;ll report and downvote you.&rdquo; ARE YOU KIDDING ME? We should be saying &ldquo;look at AMC, this shows us that the FTD cycle and naked shorting are happening to yet another GME-related stock. This is further evidence for our theory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, please PLEASE stop saying that bullshit about AMC being a ploy to make us forget about GME. That is illogical, makes us look like conspiracy theorists, divides retail, and makes us look jealous. Do you realize that the fact that GME and AMC are rising in concert is further evidence that we are correct about all of this? It shows that HFs are being forced to cover on specific dates. If GME and AMC went up and down separately then the media would probably be correct about retail just buying in at random times, but this rise in concert gives us proof that they did the same thing with AMC that they did to GME (but to a lesser extent). So again, we should not be hostile to AMC - it is bad for us. Again, I do not have a position in AMC and think that GME is a better stock by miles (not financial advice). We should use the AMC run up as FURTHER PROOF that the FTD cycle theory and naked short theories are correct - we should not be saying that it&rsquo;s a distraction. To add to that, I&rsquo;ve long said that if AMC squeezes first, I&rsquo;d bet that people will use their profits on AMC to join GME.</p>
<p><strong>We are all apes, we all have the same thesis about our respective stocks, and we are all fighting the same enemy - so let&rsquo;s not divide retail with this anti-AMC nonsense.</strong></p>
<p>Before you message me, dont ask my thoughts on AMC. I am all in on GME because I like it better than AMC, so I will not be giving my thoughts on that stock, I just wanted to adress that point becuase I&rsquo;ve been seeing it a lot.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>Messages</strong></p>
<p>Finally, I just wanted to adress my messages. As I have said, my inbox is always open and I try to answer every question. Just a warning though, if you want to message me, do it through my PMs (DMs). My posts get a lot of awards and activity so it&rsquo;s much harder for me to see regular messages because they get lopped in with award notifications, so if you want to reach me I&rsquo;d recommend PMs. I&rsquo;d say my response rate to PMs is probably 95% or so, but my regular message response rate is probably only like 50%. Finally, please do not message me about price floors, &ldquo;thoughts on GME for the week,&rdquo; financial advice, selling advice, predictions, etc. as I will not be responding to these. If you have some information you&rsquo;d like to share, I&rsquo;d be happy to discuss it or if you have a question like &ldquo;what is a gamma squeeze&rdquo; I will probably answer it. But please do not ask me any questions about financial advice and the like as I will not be responding to those. To those of you who send me information, however, thank you so much. Many of you are often inspirations for my DDs and often contribute legitimate points to my DDs.</p>
<p><strong>Closing thots</strong></p>
<p>Apes, I, like many of you, feel that something is coming. The price action alone says enough but the information surrounding it says even more. As I said in my most recent warning post, be ready for some absolutely crazy price action in the coming weeks. I&rsquo;m not sure when I&rsquo;ll be posting again but I hope that it will be soon. I will not be posting just for the fuck of it, I will be posting when I have something to say, so hopefully that will be within a week or two. Many of my very close followers saw that I put out a message saying I was thinking of expanding to another platform. You all overwhelmingly said YouTube. I am not sure when I will be doing this but I think it&rsquo;s a great idea and am going to make a plan to expand sometime in the future (probably not the near future but sometime in the future). As always,</p>
<p>Stay strong, apes.</p>
<p>************ I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice ************</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I did not want this post to be about AMC but so many people have messaged me about it so I had to make this edit. It makes absolutely zero sense for a fund to spend money on AMC for the sole purpose of making apes transfer over to AMC when they could be spending that money on shorting GME. If you think that AMC doubled this week because of FUD and misinformation and not institutions buying in then you don&rsquo;t understand how markets work. No stock doubles in a week without it being because of institutional buying. Retail has power but has been holding for months, so it was not retail. If it was retail, then wouldn&rsquo;t we have seen a drop in GME due to apes selling GME to buy AMC? Instead, we saw both increases. It&rsquo;s the result of two stocks being the victims of naked shorting. I absolutely love this sub more than anything and it kills me to see this kind of illogical, confirmation bias from some of you. Again, I do not have an AMC position and think that GME is infinitely better than AMC but we need to stop with this rhetoric because it&rsquo;s not helpful.</p>
