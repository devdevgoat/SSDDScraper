<p><em>We&rsquo;re on a scheduled hold. Preliminary system checks are good enough to launch, and now we are being held for atmospheric conditions to be just right.</em></p>
<p><em>GME ignition needs to appear from the outside to be organic, or it will be fairly obvious to the public that The System is built on lies, and run by liars, completely unfair, and this stock was just being flat out controlled for months. Even if Wall St survives financially by implementing all these rules, if they lose the public trust then it is literally &ldquo;game stopped.&rdquo; They need plausible cover to launch now, the rest is in place.</em></p>

<p>Busy few weeks, eh Apes? Figured I&rsquo;d give this a brush up and post it again since it was a month ago I posted the original. So here&rsquo;s the refreshed, reviewed, reassessed, reformatted, and return of the Go / No-Go Checklist. Freshness stamp at the top, changes by date at the bottom. Please comment with any additions and corrections as always.</p>
<p> 
 </p>
<h6 id="official-notice-that-this-is-not-financial-advice-etc-etc-i-have-no-idea-if-any-of-this-is-indeed-why-these-things-are-happening-or-if-they-are-even-what-i-think-they-are-i-bought-a-handful-of-shares-before-dfvs-congressional-hearing-because-something-seemed-fucky-and-that-was-my-first-stock-purchase-ever-if-you-make-financial-decisions-off-of-this-speculation-you-probably-do-eat-crayons-like-me-i-am-literally-just-some-ape-on-the-internet-mashing-buttons-and-youre-gonna-have-to-explain-to-your-wifes-boyfriend-why-you-took-this-as-advice-and-then-spent-your-whole-allowance-already-this-week"><strong>Official notice that this is not financial advice, etc etc. I have no idea if any of this is indeed why these things are happening, or if they are even what I think they are. I bought a handful of shares before DFV&rsquo;s Congressional hearing because something seemed fucky, and that was my first stock purchase EVER. If you make financial decisions off of this speculation, you probably do eat crayons like me. I am literally just some Ape on the internet mashing buttons and you&rsquo;re gonna have to explain to your wife&rsquo;s boyfriend why you took this as advice and then spent your whole allowance already this week.</strong></h6>
<p>So this <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mu9xed/why_were_still_trading_sideways_and_why_we_havent/">post</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210513033502/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mu9xed/why_were_still_trading_sideways_and_why_we_havent/">(wb)</a> from u/c-digs is about as close as anyone has come to my personal theory that there is a literal checklist somewhere that is getting marked off before this is allowed to unravel. The DTCC and Wall St (and probably the SEC) definitely do not want this spring to unwind before they are ready, and certainly not in a way in which they don&rsquo;t feel they are in control. These players are Big Corporate dicks with Big Corporate mindsets, and its my bet that they don&rsquo;t do anything without a plan that at least addresses all eventualities.</p>
<p>However, as it is now probably alarmingly clear to them this isn&rsquo;t just gonna go away on its own (cue Apes waving from the windows of the rocket sitting on the launchpad), the DTCC and pals are now scrambling to get the last things in place before somebody trips over the cord to the shredder at 3am and lands on the launch button.</p>
<p>I think the list goes something like this, but am intending this to be <strong>a crowdsourced document</strong> because there is no way I can keep this all straight on my own, and the GME Investor community has done so so much great DD already. There is definitely more to add in terms of DTCC / OCC / NSCC / SEC rules, and please comment with additional items &amp; sources and I&rsquo;ll try to keep up with editing them into the list. Compiling it here can possibly help determine just how close GME probably is to liftoff. It feels like we aren&rsquo;t that far from it now.</p>

<h2 id="1---rules-of-engagement">1 - Rules of Engagement</h2>
<p><strong>Opinon - Status: Go for Launch</strong> ✅</p>
<p><em>The System would benefit most if new rules about payments in a member default situation are in effect prior to launch, and as far as we know at this point, all rules to cover that scenario that were filed are now in place. They can use remaining days to shore up a few more monetary rules, but there aren&rsquo;t any disaster-level rules still pending out there. My opinion is at <del>90%</del> 95% Go as we are still waiting for at least 1 important rule:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>SR-NSCC-2021-002</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s cover some basics before getting into each specific rule.</p>
<p><strong>Whose rules cover what:</strong></p>
<p>DTCC stands for Depoisitory Trust and Clearing Corporation which is made up of 3 self-regulating bodies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dtcc.com/about/businesses-and-subsidiaries/dtc">DTC</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210512124134/https://www.dtcc.com/about/businesses-and-subsidiaries/dtc">(wb)</a> - The Depository Trust Company</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dtcc.com/about/businesses-and-subsidiaries/nscc">NSCC</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210525044800/https://www.dtcc.com/about/businesses-and-subsidiaries/nscc">(wb)</a> - National Securities Clearing Corporation</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dtcc.com/about/businesses-and-subsidiaries/ficc">FICC</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210512063430/https://www.dtcc.com/about/businesses-and-subsidiaries/ficc">(wb)</a> - Fixed Income Clearing Corporation</li>
</ul>
<p>and handles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical Stock Certificates and ownership records, big institutional trades (DTC)</li>
<li>Securities trades, clearing, and settlement for nearly all transactions involving US based marketplaces (NSCC)</li>
<li>Government Securities and Mortgage-Backed Securities (FICC)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.theocc.com">OCC</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210526172459/https://www.theocc.com/">(wb)</a> - Options Clearing Coroporation handles:</p>
<p>Options (shocker, I know)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theice.com/clear-credit">ICC</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210519122104/https://www.theice.com/clear-credit">(wb)</a> - Intercontinental Exchance (ICE) Clear Credit handles:</p>
<p>Credit Default Swaps, or CDS for short.</p>
<p><strong>Naming Scheme (yes the whole thing is important)</strong></p>
<p>example: SR-DTC-2021-005</p>
<ul>
<li>SR - Type of document filed, SR = Self Regulation</li>
<li>DTC - Name of self regulated entity filing it</li>
<li>2021 - Year regulation was filed</li>
<li>005 - Sequence filed in (5th, so far)</li>
</ul>
<p>✅ = in effect now</p>
<p>❌ = pending review / revision</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SR-DTC-2021-006: Remove the Security Holder Tracking Service</strong> ✅</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The &ldquo;We&rsquo;re dropping the old way of tracking shares, cause it didn&rsquo;t work well, and DTC-2021-005 will do it better&rdquo; Rule.</em></p>
<p>It was speculated in another post that the old system of tracking needed to be removed so there was no conflict in implementing DTC-2021-005 (I can&rsquo;t find that post here on reddit anymore, src needed!). It&rsquo;s likely that this could pave the way for 005 to be implemented. As if 2021-05-20 I am more inclined to think that it was removed to keep anyone from implementing share tracking prior to 005 being implemented.

<li><strong>SR-DTC-2021-007: Update the DTC Corporate Actions Distributions Service Guide</strong> ✅</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The &ldquo;Stop bickering back and forth over the manual adjustments to your peer to peer trade records via the dumb APO method, and just use the GD computer validated Claim Connect system, please&rdquo; Rule.</em></p>
<p>Way to make a super vague title DTC&hellip; This is mostly about borrowed shares and updating who pays how much when circumstances - like rates - change. The old system (APO) needed both parties to just agree on the adjustments and one side could only submit an adjustment at a time, so it was rarely agreed upon in one pass and the bad guys could likely stall with many back and forths. To me this reads as a please use this better thing now, because APO will go away on July 9th 2021 so you&rsquo;ll have to use Claim Connect by then anyways. Since the lender is likely incentivized to use the new system, it may get adopted in higher numbers sooner.</p>

<p><em>The &ldquo;Guys, DTC had a pretty good idea, lets also liquidate members first before touching our own cash.&rdquo; Rule.</em></p>
<p>Fairly straightforward with this nugget as described by u/Criand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something really cool is they&rsquo;ll not only wipe out members who default on a certain security, they&rsquo;ll wipe out similar positions in that same security of all their other members IF it&rsquo;s high risk/stress to the market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tightens up what can and cant be considered as collateral, trimming off the stuff that is not deemed worthy, and reducing overall capital, which means you can handle less total risk and/or volatile CDS contracts.</p>

<p><em>The &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna start using our best guesses on if the collateral for the loans these psuedo-insurance contracts are based on might go crazy in the near future, &lsquo;cause shit is getting weird out there&rdquo; Rule.</em></p>

Essentially this rule appears it primarily will help to reduce the chances of say, BofA failing because they agreed to get paid to take on some of the risk of a loan made by say JP Morgan, and then BofA got fucked over just because JP Morgain made the loan using a volatile stock as collateral and then that stock went bananas&hellip; a stock which everyone probably knew was volatile but somehow wasn&rsquo;t a big factor in making the agreement before this rule. The rule also limits the ICC maximum total losses/payout, and ups initial margin requirements.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>The &ldquo;We&rsquo;re basing risk on day to day averages now instead of month to month averages&rdquo; Rule.</em></p>
<p>When something strays too far outside of the acceptable baseline, it gets flagged. Now that baseline is automatically calculated day to day, instead of month to month, and manualy reviewed the old way at least monthly. It will result in faster response time to fast moving changes and real risks (safer), but also less shock from too few updates (smoother). All that so they can keep margin levels appropriate. Also cleans up some language to be more generic and descriptive like &ldquo;Extreme Price Change Scenarios.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edit 2021-05-22:</p>
<p>Typos, add expected effective timeframe for DTC-2021-005. May 27th SEC Meeting Scheduled. SEC Lawsuit. Restructured the 3rd/Cover section to clarify for some comments and feedback about why I think cover is important. Also by now I&rsquo;ve got plenty of reddit points/currency, so spend new money on GME!</p>
<p>Edit 2021-05-28:</p>
<p>SR-OCC-2021-003 approved. Add CPI release as market drop cover, US Treasury meeting, US Budget Proposal.</p>
