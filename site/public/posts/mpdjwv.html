<p>EDIT: I DON&rsquo;T WANT YOUR UPVOTES, I DON&rsquo;T WANT YOUR AWARDS. I WANT YOU TO READ THE ATTACHED POST</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t care less about Karma, even less about fake awards. I am not HODLing GME for Krama!</p>
<p>NOTE: The OP doesn&rsquo;t say he called TD in the post, he says it in the comments do a search for &ldquo;Yea that&rsquo;s why I posted the screenshots (also called TD to confirm so yea their legit)&rdquo; you will see it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just tryin to bring attention to the OP, not to me FFS</p>
