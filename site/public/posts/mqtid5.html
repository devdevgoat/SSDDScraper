<p>The purpose of the proposed rule change is to enhance the Exchange’s Retail Price Improvement Program for the <strong>benefit of retail investors.</strong> Specifically, the Exchange proposes to make the following four changes: (i) revise the definition of Retail order in IEX Rule 11.190(b)(15) to <strong>apply only to the trading interest of a natural person that does not place more than 390 equity orders per day</strong> on average during a calendar month for its own beneficial account(s);7 (ii) <strong>provide Order Book8 priority to Retail Liquidity Provider (“RLP”) orders9 at the Midpoint Price10 ahead of other non-displayed orders priced to execute at the Midpoint Price;</strong> (iii) disseminate a “Retail Liquidity Identifier” through the Exchange’s proprietary market data feeds and the appropriate securities information processor (“SIP”) when RLP order interest aggregated to form at least one round lot for a particular security is available in the System,11 provided that the RLP order interest is resting at the Midpoint Price and is <strong>priced at least $0.001 better than the NBB12 or NBO13</strong>; and (iv) amend the definition of RLP orders so <strong>such orders can only be midpoint peg orders</strong>,14 cannot be Discretionary Peg orders,15 and cannot include a minimum quantity restriction.16 The proposed changes are designed to further support and enhance the ability of non-professional retail investors to obtain meaningful price improvement by incentivizing market participants to compete to provide such price improvement.</p>
<p>Retail Liquidity Provider means a broker that routes retail orders through the IEX. You can call your broker and see if they are an RLP for IEX.</p>
<p><strong>Ape speak:</strong></p>
<p><em>This completely negates the ability for other firms to see retail orders before execution and then act accordingly to manipulate the price. This would give retail orders</em> <em><strong>Priority over other non-displayed orders. These orders are routinely used to drop price even when buying pressure is increased.</strong></em></p>
<p>Read some of the DD to learn a bit on how <strong>non displayed orders</strong> are likely being used by citadel and friends to manipulate the price.</p>
<p>Overall, it seems like a major step in the right direction to help level the playing field. It looks like it has to go through the traditional comment period before approval. (Not an advance notice).</p>
<p>Still reading will add more as needed.</p>
