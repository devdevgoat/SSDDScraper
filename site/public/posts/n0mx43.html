 in my haste to get this message out to all you apes, my title incorrectly says 2020 Annual Report&hellip; it should say 2021 Annual Report is CORRECTLY referring to the 2020 Annual Report that will be filed in 2021, not the 2019 Annual Report that was filed in 2020, in response to some questions/comments by apes in this and other posts. Thank you u/hdeck for catching that.

<p><strong>EDIT 3: ALTERNATIVE LINKS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes I am aware that some of you have many wrinkles and are familiar with alternative links on proxy websites.</li>
<li>If you want to go ahead and use them, that&rsquo;s fine. <strong>You do you.</strong></li>
<li>There have been many informative posts submitted by users recently regarding cyber-security.</li>
<li>We are learning how to protect ourselves in the digital era.</li>
<li>But given the influx of shills/fuds/phishing scams in the past few weeks, especially when it comes to proxy voting, the purpose if this post is to provide <strong>SOLID, CLEAR AND EASY TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS</strong> for apes who are not familiar with these matters.</li>
<li>The links that I have posted are solid, verifiable information.</li>
<li><strong>ANY INFORMATION THAT IS AVAILABLE ON ANY OTHER WEBSITE, WILL ALSO BE AVAILABE ON THE TWO LINKS THAT I POSTED.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>______________________</p>
<p>Apes,</p>
<p>We are seeing an influx of posts linking to an UNVERIFIED version of Gamestop&rsquo;s 2020 Annual Financial Report. I know that you are all excited and want to dig in! Believe me, as someone who deals with SEC filings for a living, I&rsquo;m also excited!</p>
<p>BUT, before anyone starts digging into this and posting their thoughts/interpretations/DD, let&rsquo;s wait until Gamestop uploads the Annual Financial Report to their website and submits it in their SEC filings. The link above could be the official 2020 Annual Report, but we don&rsquo;t know that yet.</p>
<p><strong>And it doesn&rsquo;t matter if that is the correct version or not.</strong></p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s only one important lesson that we all need to learn, if there is <strong>ONLY ONE WRINKLE YOUR APE BRAIN CAN FORM</strong>, it&rsquo;s this: <strong>ONLY REFER TO GAMESTOP&rsquo;S WEBSITE OR THE SEC WEBSITE FOR FILINGS</strong>. Do not, ever, for any reason, whatsoever, at any point in time, ever, ever, ever, refer to any website or link OTHER THAN what you can find directly available on Gamestop&rsquo;s website OR the SEC website.</p>
<p>FYI - All voting information is available directly in <a href="https://investor.gamestop.com/node/18846/html">Gamestop&rsquo;s DEF 14A filing</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210422214546/https://investor.gamestop.com/node/18846/html">(wb)</a>. u/Leaglese and I are working on a comprehensive Voting DD for all you apes around the world, we&rsquo;ll be posting something shortly.</p>
<p>If we wait for the version uploaded to Gamestop&rsquo;s website or to the SEC website, we can all make sure we are working from the correct, official version of the document.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Apes are posting misinformation/FUD. Far from it. This is just to clarify which links we should be using, because these are the same links that professionals use.</p>
<p><strong>We should all get used to referring to official Gamestop Legal Documents that are available only on the following two websites:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://investor.gamestop.com/financial-information/annual-reports">https://investor.gamestop.com/financial-information/annual-reports</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210127095908/https://investor.gamestop.com/financial-information/annual-reports">(wb)</a></li>
