			<p>From previous DD, we&rsquo;ve discovered</p>
<p>1.) BlackRock has the most shares in both AMC/GME, (<a href="https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/institutional-ownership/">Marketbeat</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210326234134/https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/institutional-ownership/">(wb)</a>)</p>
<p>2.) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/mjm39k/whos_in_bed_with_who_part_1_amc_ceo_adam_aron/">They have a strong relationship tie to Adam Aron</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210404013304/https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/mjm39k/whos_in_bed_with_who_part_1_amc_ceo_adam_aron/">(wb)</a>, CEO of AMC</p>
<p>3.) They hold their &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-03-29/blackrock-s-rieder-running-highest-level-of-cash-in-years-video">highest level of cash in years</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210329150831/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-03-29/blackrock-s-rieder-running-highest-level-of-cash-in-years-video">(wb)</a>&hellip;&rdquo; [Please watch that video if you want to understand my BlackRock CIO references]</p>
<p>**4) <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-founder-of-chewy-com-on-finding-the-financing-to-achieve-scale">Ryan Cohen &amp; Chewy received $350MIL in six rounds of funding</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210213165102/https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-founder-of-chewy-com-on-finding-the-financing-to-achieve-scale">(wb)</a>, one of which was BlackRock.</p>
<p>Now I want to dispel a myth, Elon Musk has spoken out AGAINST BlackRock (/Vanguard). <strong>I DO NOT believe they are friendly whales on GME</strong>. Instead, I believe their CIO has a knack for playing both sides of the fence.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/elon-musk-says-on-twitter-blackrock-helps-short-sellers.html">PLEASE READ THIS ARTICLE</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110041543/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/elon-musk-says-on-twitter-blackrock-helps-short-sellers.html">(wb)</a>&hellip;</p>
<p>At first, after reading it, I was disillusioned, but then I thought more on it&hellip;</p>
<p>If what the TechnoKing of Tesla alleges is true, odds are BlackRock has repeated this pattern with GME (possibly AMC) and loaned our their $9+MILLION shares to short-sellers. Likely those short-sellers were hedge funds. And more than likely, when they sold those borrowed shares and <strong>WE BOUGHT THEM</strong>.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s back-up to the previous video of BlackRock&rsquo;s CIO mentioning the fallout of Billy Hwang&rsquo;s topple, how overleveraged (and illiquid) the market may be AND dropping that BlackRock is running their &ldquo;HIGHEST CASH POSITION IN YEARS&hellip; PERHAPS EVER.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, if I knew there was a likely crashing of stocks, I&rsquo;d also keep my cash reserves high for the looming fire-sale. BlackRock CIO also admits expecting more volatility in the market, but what he doesn&rsquo;t say is BlackRock may be in a position to create that volatility by calling back their shares from short-sellers.</p>
<p>Remember GME has a <em>negative beta of 13 to 33</em> [depending on which metric for beta you use].</p>
<p>When they recall those shares, given my assumption that they&rsquo;ll continue their <em>both-sides-of-the-fence</em> trading strategy, the borrowers HAVE TO REPURCHASE THEM IN THE MARKET&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="and-that-dear-apes--moass">And that, dear apes = MOASS</h1>
<p>Now, &lsquo;tists, please help me with this; if you are a hedge fund that loans out your shares, is there a timetable for when your shares are due back to you?</p>
<p>Can you loan them out and collect interest everyday until they&rsquo;re repaid, i-e you&rsquo;re getting paid no matter?</p>
<p>Can you sell shares you&rsquo;ve loaned out as the squeeze is happening even though those shares HAVE YET TO BE RETURNED? I-e do you miss the potential high $$ sale-point per share during the squeeze?</p>
<p>Therefore, I&rsquo;ll inject my fancy-shmancy new term <em><strong>Latent Buying Pressure</strong></em>, which only increases (<em>latent boner pressure</em> works too) how BlackRock-to-shortsellers-to-retail-to-BlackRock share recall-to-shortseller repurchase mania = MOASS.</p>
<p>Simply put, if this is true, it&rsquo;s another explosive element to add to this powder-fucking-keg of a stock.</p>
<p><em>PLEASE CORRECT ANY ISSUES IN THIS LOGIC. I&rsquo;ve been stewing over this for a week or so now and I Just want to understand it correctly.</em></p>
<p>ADDENDUM</p>
<p>Another post that thickens the plot of what I allege above (specifically the battle between two hedge funds, <strong>SIG &amp; Citadel</strong> versus <strong>BlackRock &amp;Vanguard</strong>, how Tesla is another battlefield betwixt the two can be found here:</p>

<p>ADDENDUM II</p>
<p>Read this excellent breakdown of our current market mechanics, the shorts, naked shorts, how the ETF (Eee Tee Eff) market has serious exposure potential, the Bank of Japan as a test case for what we won&rsquo;t be doing.</p>
