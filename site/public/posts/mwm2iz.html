TL;DR: Margin is calling. Below is a list of a bunch of other stocks that SPECIFICALLY CITADEL is shorting into oblivion to make money to pay for their debt. Oh, by the way, it&rsquo;s not working out for them.
Not financial advice. I just like the stock. All of them.

<p><strong>TL;DR: Margin is calling. Below is a list of a bunch of other stocks that SPECIFICALLY CITADEL is shorting into oblivion to make money to pay for their debt. Oh, by the way, it&rsquo;s not working out for them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Not financial advice. I just like the stock. All of them.</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep this short and sweet, it&rsquo;s just a bunch of Ortex/FINRA data on <strong>stocks that</strong> <strong>Citadel is MASS PRINTING</strong> to make their money back. You will see some crazy shit here.</p>
<p>The goal of this DD is to <strong>show the correlation between some MASSIVELY shorted stocks that have yet to cover as of 4/22</strong> and <strong>Citadel&rsquo;s involvement within the OTC/Dark Pools.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the tendie man, $GME as our reference. Remember that <strong>the short data for $GME is MASSIVELY INACCURATE because they have only pretended to cover by buying ITM calls.</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/fm867xvi5vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We know already what&rsquo;s going on with $GME, don&rsquo;t need to get into it. Same for $AMC. I would post photos of the Ortex and FINRA data but Reddit has a 20 image post limit. Dumb, but I&rsquo;m sure you get the point.</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s where things get <strong>CRAZY.</strong> Have you heard of <strong>Ocugen? ($OCGN)</strong></p>
<p>Neither had I. Until I noticed that <strong>THE ENTIRE THING IS SHORTED TO 100% UTILIZATION AND MORE THAN THE FLOAT (189M) TRADED TODAY, 4/22.</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/v36lkbuk5vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the weird thing: <strong>THE PRICE IS GOING</strong> <em><strong>UP.</strong></em> Shorted stocks <strong>DON&rsquo;T GO UP. Unless&hellip; YOU&rsquo;RE PRINTING SHARES JUST TO PRINT THEM TO MAKE MONEY WITH NO REPERCUSSIONS.</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe me? Well&hellip;</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/us7ezvto5vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Did I mention that <strong>THE PUBLIC FLOAT OF $OCGN IS ONLY 189M? SEEMS SUS&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>It goes deeper. Ever heard of $VXRT? You know, <strong>THE ONE WITH THE NEGATIVE BETA?</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/ure7yeir5vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Hmm I wonder if it&rsquo;s been shorted&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/janmdn1u5vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>HMM, THAT&rsquo;S STRANGE&hellip; BY CITADEL? YOU PRINTING SHARES OVER THERE?</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/lowjb5hv5vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, isn&rsquo;t that interesting. Keep in mind too that the stock is <strong>GOING UP</strong> as well, meaning since they can&rsquo;t pull out, <strong>THEY MUST GO DEEPER.</strong> Just kidding, although remember that they <strong>MAKE MONEY</strong> printing shares, and demand has shot up for $VXRT.</p>
<p>Okay so what else? How about:</p>
<ol>
<li>$FSR: <strong>134M Float</strong></li>
<li>$NKLA: <strong>169M Float</strong></li>
<li>$SKLZ: <strong>227M Float</strong></li>
<li>$MVIS: <strong>155M Float</strong></li>
<li>$RIOT: <strong>82M Float</strong></li>
<li>$ALDX: <strong>38M Float</strong></li>
<li>$BNGO: <strong>276M Float</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yup. And those are just the ones I found in a couple of hours. The list is <strong>most likely enormous.</strong></p>
<p>You want the data? <strong>Here&rsquo;s the data with comments on each image:</strong></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s <strong>$FSR:</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/qntpq2ox5vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/m7jihl336vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s <strong>$NKLA:</strong> Look at that <strong>HUGE spike in volume, and there AIN&rsquo;T NO SHORTS BEING COVERED.</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/de6tef166vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/a9dlrnx76vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s $SKLZ. <strong>Look at the price action at the end. It&rsquo;s GOING UP despite the short interest. Someone AIN&rsquo;T COVERING.</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/z78x3cw96vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/2jor3ekb6vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s <strong>$MVIS, a WallStreetBets favorite.</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/siwo0dud6vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/2sgq1itf6vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s <strong>$RIOT.</strong> Did you know that <strong>THEY SHORTED IT BY TWICE ITS FLOAT OTC? (82M)?</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/1qys7unh6vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/eyp9sqqj6vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s <strong>$ALDX.</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/amijboyl6vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s <strong>$BNGO. Again, look at the price action. It&rsquo;s going UP. And if shorts AREN&rsquo;T RESPONSIBLE for it, then MARGIN CALLS will be coming for similar situations.</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/qy42t2tr6vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="../img/ux2o97ut6vu61.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>So what have we learned?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Buy more $GME. Buy more $AMC.</strong> You can risk the other ones in this list, <strong>but personally I like the stonk.</strong> The way we win this thing <strong>is if we HODL ON WHILE THE PRICE CLIMBS,</strong> and while these stonks certainly can and most likely will go up, <strong>they are more of a demonstration that Citadel and friends are most certainly fuk.</strong> These stonks are shorted into oblivion to stave Citadel its execution, <strong>which is coming for them very soon.</strong></p>
<p>Edit 1: Added some clarification, added &ldquo;not financial advice,&rdquo; clarified that we actually just really like the stonk.</p>
