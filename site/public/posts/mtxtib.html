<p>If you or your parents have their retirement accounts <strong>PASSIVELY MANAGED BY BIG BANKS OR INSTITUTIONS</strong>, as opposed to actively-manages funds or having independent financial advisors, PLEASE LISTEN. A passively managed account <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/what-difference-between-passive-and-active-portfolio-management.asp">explained by investopedia here</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210125204113/https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/what-difference-between-passive-and-active-portfolio-management.asp">(wb)</a> means the bank or institution will invest your savings &ldquo;according to a strategy&rdquo; instead of you having full control:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An <em>actively</em> managed investment fund has an individual portfolio¬†manager, co-managers, or a team of managers all making investment decisions for the fund. The success of the fund depends on in-depth research, market forecasting, and the expertise of the management team.</p>
<p>A <em><strong>passive strategy</strong></em> does not have a management team making investment decisions and can be structured as an exchange-traded fund (ETF), a mutual fund, or a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uit.asp">unit investment trust</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210302171300/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uit.asp">(wb)</a>.</p>
<p>Index funds are branded as passively managed rather than unmanaged because each has a portfolio manager who is in charge of replicating the index.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Passive strategies are not &ldquo;actively managed&rdquo; for best results, but people trust that big banks have the smartest minds managing portfolios, and &ldquo;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp">fiduciary obligations</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210419155927/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp">(wb)</a>&rdquo; will require them to use those minds to act in my best interests, right??</p>

<p>Well, over the past 4 months of intense brain wrinkling, I learned that many brilliant minds think that a market crash is unavoidable in the near future. <a href="https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1362635795052421123">As he states here,</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210419140805/https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1362635795052421123">(wb)</a> <strong>Dr. Brrrrry believes that a market crash is inevitable, inflation will happen, and both b$tco$n and gold will suffer due to governments directly competing with them for currency.</strong> <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/01/the-feds-tipsy-portfolio-and-inflation-expectations/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">He linked to an article here on TIPS,</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210227182854/https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/01/the-feds-tipsy-portfolio-and-inflation-expectations/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">(wb)</a> &ldquo;treasury inflation-protected securities.&rdquo; It explains that they may not be safe from inflation after all <em>and</em> the Fed is buying up almost all of what the Treasury is issuing. <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/default.htm">About 1/5th of <strong>ALL</strong> U.S. dollars currently in existence were printed last year</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210410170706/https://www.federalreserve.gov/Releases/H6/current/default.htm">(wb)</a>, and the <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/1381/debt-to-gdp-ratio-historical-chart">debt-to-GDP ratio is near its historical high</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210310223345/https://www.macrotrends.net/1381/debt-to-gdp-ratio-historical-chart">(wb)</a>, having jumped from 107% to 129% <em>in the last year alone.</em> That&rsquo;s <em>as big of an increase as 2009-2020</em>- all in the last year. <a href="https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics">Margin debt carried by big banks</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210416052905/https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics">(wb)</a> is up almost double from last year and near historical highs, and that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg.

<p>Reading is really hard so I had to use my crayons, but that says banks own over $163 <strong>T</strong>rillion in derivatives based on $19 Trillion of assets, and <em>Holding Companies</em> own over $218 <strong>T</strong>rillion in derivatives based on $17 Trillion of assets. <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-money-and-markets-in-one-visualization-2020/">Check out an infographic on all of the world&rsquo;s money here</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210417124655/https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-money-and-markets-in-one-visualization-2020/">(wb)</a> if you want, I can&rsquo;t add that high.</p>
<p>Dr. Brrrry posted the following chart on investments that have historically protected one from inflation by rising in value directly proportional to amount of inflation, <a href="https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1363909572243705859">source:</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210505184540/https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1363909572243705859">(wb)</a></p>
<p><img src="../img/k45f7mjcx3u61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Q4 filings showing what Warren Buffet has been up to convinced me that all of this is real, <a href="https://www.dataroma.com/m/m_activity.php?m=BRK&amp;typ=a">summarized on this webpage.</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201117014213/https://www.dataroma.com/m/m_activity.php?m=BRK&amp;typ=a">(wb)</a> Buffet, the guy who says &ldquo;our favorite holding period is forever&rdquo; and has always loved bank stocks, just sold huge amounts of stock- 100% out of some positions- here are some of the biggest sells:</p>

<p><img src="../img/ikn5wzdmx3u61.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="../img/qerodihpx3u61.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="../img/8mc5mywqx3u61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>His buys match up nearly perfectly with things that rise in value along with inflation according to Dr. Brrrrry&rsquo;s table. His sells match up nearly perfectly with all the banks and companies that will suffer if Brrrry&rsquo;s thesis about debt bubble bursting + inflation is correct. <em>Including selling off 100% of his position in gold.</em></p>
<h1 id="fuuuuuuuucccccccckkkkkkk">fuuuuuuuucccccccckkkkkkk.</h1>
<p>Biases fully confirmed, I called my parents to warn them of things to come. (I posted that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/mt6fiq/psa_call_your_parents_and_ask_them_if_their/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">here</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210419092809/https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/mt6fiq/psa_call_your_parents_and_ask_them_if_their/">(wb)</a>.) My experience was unsettling- I learned that their retirement savings were in passively managed accounts through large institutions. My mom had chosen how &ldquo;risky&rdquo; she wanted her investments to be- she chose a 50/50 plan, she said- and let the institution allocate accordingly.</p>
<p>Turns out her investments are in 60% stocks, <strong>40% bonds.</strong> My dad has even more in bonds than that. I realize that this is a very common investment strategy for retirement funds, and in most markets provides a dependable, unchanging amount of money back-per-investment.</p>
<p>Dependable, unless you&rsquo;re concerned about a market crash, inflation, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/flood-of-new-debt-tests-bond-market-11615372201">major dilution of the bonds market.</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210419133910/https://www.wsj.com/articles/flood-of-new-debt-tests-bond-market-11615372201">(wb)</a></p>

<p>I then learned that my <em>husband&rsquo;s</em> parents employ an independent financial advisor to &ldquo;actively manage&rdquo; their retirement funds, paid on commission based on their fund&rsquo;s performance. That advisor had moved his parents' funds <em>almost entirely out of bonds,</em> <em><strong>and started doing so over four years ago.</strong></em> Neither of his parents work any more- they&rsquo;re entirely dependent on that money for the rest of their lives- it&rsquo;s not something they would take any risks with. Knowing that, their advisor <em>still</em> made this move <em>and</em> went so far as to give his parents a book, <a href="https://prezi.com/nwnd3jgtqff5/be-an-owner-not-a-loaner/">&ldquo;Be an Owner, Not a Loaner&rdquo;</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210419104353/https://prezi.com/nwnd3jgtqff5/be-an-owner-not-a-loaner/">(wb)</a>, explaining the difference between how bonds and stocks would retain value based on current market conditions.</p>
<p>Yet here were <em>my</em> parents, having chosen low levels of risk, having their money being invested in <em><strong>40%+ in bonds.</strong></em></p>
<p>If you check out <a href="https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/retirement-insights/guide-to-retirement/">J.P. Morgan&rsquo;s retirement guide here,</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210406151450/https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/retirement-insights/guide-to-retirement/">(wb)</a> they actually recommend a portfolio of <strong>60% bonds</strong> if you have &ldquo;medium-term goals&rdquo; like college or home loans.</p>

<p>So&hellip;. according to the sacks at Sachs, my husband&rsquo;s retired parents have their money in the &ldquo;highest risk&rdquo; portfolio possible.

<p>Strong correlation between debt over-exposure and the banks that Warren Buffet sold 100% of.
