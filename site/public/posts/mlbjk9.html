<p><strong>Edit 21 4:01PM:</strong></p>
<p>Ending the day around 184.40, down 1.36%. Overall a good day for the bullish. IV crush continuing and setting up the ideal conditions for a gamma squeeze.</p>
<p><img src="../img/lpprvk960mr61.png" alt="">
<strong>Edit 20 3:00PM:</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back on my power hour stream, you know where to find me. Will keep updating this doc.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 19 2:44PM:</strong></p>
<p>183.5 support if we cross the current level.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 18 1:58PM:</strong></p>
<p><img src="../img/0k0ussk8elr61.png" alt="">
<strong>Edit 17 1:36PM:</strong></p>
<p>Small pullback on pretty low volume. Nothing too interesting.</p>
<p><img src="../img/47lq8h96alr61.png" alt="">
<strong>Edit 16 1:30PM:</strong></p>
<p>Basically due to the lack of fundamental catalysts, we are waiting patiently for forces behind the scenes to move the stock price. It&rsquo;s always eerily quiet during periods like right now.</p>
<p>Forget options chain, forget TA, what&rsquo;s coming soon is a chain of business maneuvers that can push the price. So whether that be a share recall, a change in leadership, big business changes are underway. Eventually we&rsquo;ll likely walk out of the eye of the storm, and get flung into the sky and catch a rocket to the moon :D</p>
<p><strong>Edit 15 1:28PM:</strong></p>
<p>Sorry little crayon typo in edit 12. I drew the first circle on the wrong day, fixed it now!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 14 1:22PM:</strong></p>
<p>By eye of the storm, we were hit in January, turbulence in Feb, and now late March and early April seems to be the eye. It&rsquo;s always oddly quiet in the eye.</p>
<p>My take on those 330 and 340 strike Put walls is perhaps those are post squeeze bets. You basically want to buy to open Puts during the lowest IV trading period so later you can sell to close during a high IV nosedive.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 13 1:12PM:</strong></p>
<p>Today might be the eye of the storm.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 12 12:47PM:</strong></p>
<p>Most likely will have to wait till power hour for any major movements. I&rsquo;m expecting some action either Thursday or Friday, will be colliding horizontally with a major resistance line.</p>

<strong>Edit 11 12:27PM:</strong></p>
<p>Great post from u/bobbychow305 about Webull lending. I would recommend you guys turn of lending by following the info in his post!</p>

<p><strong>Edit 10 11:48AM:</strong></p>
<p>Sideways, low volume, excuse the boring price action!</p>
<p><img src="../img/5s6bvdbwqkr61.png" alt="">
<strong>Edit 9 11:07AM:</strong></p>
<p>Double top as expected. We should consolidate around VWAP.</p>
<p><img src="../img/2o2jemvljkr61.png" alt="">
<strong>Edit 8 10:49AM:</strong></p>
<p>We bounced off the resistance, possibly a bull flag followed by a double top.</p>
<p><img src="../img/46zq2d4dgkr61.png" alt="">
<strong>Edit 7 10:33AM:</strong></p>
<p>Edit 2 resistance tested.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 6 10:31AM:</strong></p>
<p>Nothing crazy on optionsonar. &lt;100k orders mostly on OTM Puts.</p>
<p><img src="../img/qmd5amv1dkr61.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Edit 5 10:21AM:</strong></p>
<p>Volume still extremely low, expect mostly sideways action today.</p>
<p><img src="../img/x3wxu3g9bkr61.png" alt="">
<strong>Edit 4 10:07AM:</strong></p>
<p>Descending channel with breakout to the upside. Nothing too interesting in options right now.</p>
<p><img src="../img/o2g9zkpr8kr61.png" alt="">
<strong>Edit 3 9:41AM:</strong></p>
<p>Extremely low volume, 280k first minute candle. It&rsquo;s like the eye of the storm. Nothing too interesting happening right now.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2 9:33AM:</strong></p>
<p>Possible resistance we might test later in the day. <strong>This is not a prediction, just a possibility.</strong></p>
<p><img src="../img/df5l38tq2kr61.png" alt="">
<strong>Edit 1 9:29AM:</strong></p>
<p>Added 186 support. Likely mini selloff touching 186 first minute candle, then small bounce.</p>

Gooooood morning my fellow apes!</p>
<p>Seems Michael Burry deleted his Twitter huh? Seems he actually knew what he was talking about!</p>
<p>I sense a storm is coming. I hope you all went to Wendy&rsquo;s and got yourselves a nice meal, because this is gonna be a long car trip down a windy road before we reach our destination.</p>
<p>A quick reminder that I will be dual posting here and streaming on <a href="https://youtu.be/MI7WIo25eF0">https://youtu.be/MI7WIo25eF0</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/MI7WIo25eF0">(wb)</a>.</p>
<h1 id="premarket-analysis">Premarket analysis</h1>
<p>Broader market down pre-market. Gap down with fade up for GameStop.</p>
