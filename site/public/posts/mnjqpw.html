<p>STAY READY. A few green days doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. Expect a wave of BS to hit. The good news is we have their entire playbook going back to January.</p>

We may have strict posting requirements around gain porn here in /r/superstonk, but other subs do not. Prepare yourself to see all kinds of posts of people that sold early on those subs.</p>
<p>The first battle for the HFs is to prevent the MOASS, the next will be to get you to sell early when the MOASS starts. <strong>Every single dirty trick on this list can and will be used again once the MOASS starts, and I would expect it to be spread to every single GME related sub.</strong></p>
