			<p>Hello apes/retards. I&rsquo;d like to propose a theory in regards to some of the data that&rsquo;s been floating around over the past few days.</p>
<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve seen <a href="https://i.redd.it/b8aqf56cvds61.jpg">data published by FINRA</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210412124840/https://i.redd.it/b8aqf56cvds61.jpg">(wb)</a> which describes total equity ownership ~192%. Many people have insinuated that this % is not accurate due to duplicates of the same entity. However, you can verify that some these entities are not the same, and represent transactions from parent&gt;child or entirely separate positions held by affiliates.</p>
<p>The one example I&rsquo;d like to focus on is <em>BlackRock Fund Advisors</em>. Now, some people have conflated the position posted on FINRA as a duplicate of BlackRock Inc. But this is not the case. As you can see from <a href="https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/blackrock">this report of GME ownership via BlackRock Inc</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210204072102/https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/blackrock">(wb)</a>, and a similar report of <a href="https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/blackrock-fund-advisors">BlackRock Fund Advisors GME ownership</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210412060719/https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/blackrock-fund-advisors">(wb)</a>, (courtesy of Fintel), both institutions, (albeit under the umbrella of BlackRock), manage or managed their own separate financial positions.</p>
<p>One of the interesting details in the Fintel data is that sometime around the end of 2016, BlackRock Fund advisors stopped reporting its position in GME, and around the same time BlackRock Inc began reporting a position, likely due to a transfer of ownership from one affiliate to another, (child to parent in this case). Great, but why is this important? Well, if you check FINRAs <a href="https://i.redd.it/b8aqf56cvds61.jpg">recent data once more</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210412124840/https://i.redd.it/b8aqf56cvds61.jpg">(wb)</a>, you&rsquo;ll notice that BlackRock Fund Advisors is listed once again, separate from BlackRock Inc, and with a <strong>14 MILLION SHARE POSITION CHANGE</strong>.</p>
<p>Wait a second though&hellip; How can it be that BlackRock purchased 14 million shares, <img src="../img/1ez3uzt48ns61.jpg" alt=""> Well, that&rsquo;s a great question of which I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out, but it&rsquo;s tough to determine because BlackRock Fund Advisors is basically re-entering the ring. I presume that Bloomberg Terminal data only displays static institutional ownership change, (either + or - 5% changes), via 13F filings. But if BlackRock Fund Advisors had not been registered as a subsidiary shareholder up until recently, and then all of a sudden within the span of a month decided to purchase 14 million shares from the open market, Terminal may not be picking up that data, (at least for the time being).</p>
<p>So, BlackRock has been purchasing shares from the open market for the past month or so via a subsidiary that is not represented in Terminal. On top of that, most of those shares are probably synthetic. I&rsquo;d like to also point out an important discrepancy here when it comes to share recalls. When you, (as a retail investor), purchase shares, you are purchasing shares from your broker. Your broker has either purchased shares in the past, or they are purchasing shares from the open market in order to meet the increased demand of their customers. In the big picture, when you recall, you&rsquo;re most likely not recalling shares which were lent out or of which are considered synthetic, (unless you&rsquo;re on a margin account, or other situations of which I don&rsquo;t want to delve into). Now, when an institution purchases shares, they are not purchasing from a broker like Fidelity, they are purchasing direct from the market, or at least via a broker purchasing direct from the market. This means that institutions that are long most likely hold an abnormal % of synthetic shares.</p>
<p>Okay, so what does this all mean? Well&hellip; If BlackRock has a subsidiary purchasing shares, and most of those shares are synthetic, what happens when BlackRock decides to recall their shares? What if BlackRock Fund Advisors not only purchased shares within this span of time, but also lent out those shares, and said shares were synthesized multiple times over? What if BlackRock Inc was doing the same, (not purchasing more shares as their position hasn&rsquo;t changed, but lending shares out)?</p>
<p>Additionally, what if there&rsquo;s a shareholder annual meeting in June of this year, and the deadline to recall those shares is within the next 8 days? What if BlackRock has a hard-on for Ryan Cohen, and they&rsquo;re ready to ultra fuck Citadel? If they wanted to, they could <strong>HYPER FUCK SHITADEL SO HARD THEY WOULD BE DELETED FROM EXISTENCE</strong>.</p>
<p>TLDR: BlackRock has a subsidiary that purchased an ungodly # of synthetic shares, and they&rsquo;re positioned to fuck Shitadel so hard that they will be put into the history books.</p>
<p>P.S. Please Please Please critique my semi-DD and poke holes, because we as a community need to get every detail right, and we need to be as confident as possible in our research. As always, 💎✊, and be ready to join hands together when this rocket launches to Alpha Centauri!</p>
<p>Edit: Adding the <em>this is not financial advice</em> disclaimer because blah blah don&rsquo;t come after me</p>
