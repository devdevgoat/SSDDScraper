<p>Tesla:</p>
<p>20M calls</p>
<p>18M puts</p>
<p>what did Tesla do this week?</p>

Tesla over the last 30 days went from 600 to 745 and in the last 5 days it started dropping.</p>
<p>And all of that despite the news that their had a fantastic quarter and also that they managed to profit with over 100M+ in their BTC sale.</p>

Now I&rsquo;ll start choosing completely random Citadel holding from their 13F.</p>
<p>ABT</p>
<p>1,1M calls</p>
<p>937k puts</p>
