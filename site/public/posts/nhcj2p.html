			<p>What&rsquo;s up Apes</p>
<p>TLDR at the bottom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been sitting on my FOIA requests for about two months now, not wanting to make a post until I received an actual response. My request for a fee waiver was granted, so I didn&rsquo;t have to spend any $$$ better suited for more crayons to shove between my gorilla molars, but my request for an expedited process was denied. Apparently the financial risks to hundreds of thousands of Ape wallets doesn&rsquo;t constitute a national emergency, so I had to wait two more months before hearing anything back.</p>
<p>Imagine my delight this week when those emails finally popped up in my inbox. Unlike <em>some</em> people (or government agencies), I won&rsquo;t waste any time scratching my own balls before sharing this information with those that deserve it. One, because anatomically I don&rsquo;t have any balls, and two, because fucking duh.</p>
<p>(In all seriousness though, I&rsquo;m just being coy. It could very well have taken them two months to scour all their records. I know jack shit about what kind of archives and record-keeping systems they have up in the SEC.)</p>
<p>Also, none of this is financial advice. I&rsquo;m literally an idiot. And nothing in this post is meant, in any shape or form, as any type of advice, financial or otherwise. I&rsquo;m just a little ape who sent in an FOIA request, got a response, and am sharing it with the sub. What you do with this information is your own prerogative. I&rsquo;m still HODL because that&rsquo;s <em>my</em> prerogative.</p>
<h1 id="before-i-get-into-it-though-some-background">Before I get into it, though, some background.</h1>
<p>For those of you who are unaware, the Freedom of Information Act allows members of the public (like you and me) &ldquo;the right to request access to records from any federal agency.&rdquo; These federal agencies are required to disclose information requested under the FOIA <strong>unless</strong> the information falls under one of nine exemptions with the general purpose of protecting personal privacy, law enforcement, and national security (because fucking duh). In which case, the individual who requested the information will receive a polite little email to tell them that their request will not be granted (and a list of the relevant exemptions why).</p>
<p>The nine exemptions are, in detail (found on the <a href="https://FOIA.gov">FOIA.gov</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210528084005/https://www.foia.gov/">(wb)</a> <a href="https://www.foia.gov/faq.html">FAQ</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210602161935/https://www.foia.gov/faq.html">(wb)</a>):</p>

<h1 id="my-foia-request">My FOIA Request</h1>
<p>On April 2nd, 2021, I submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the SEC. I specifically requested records <strong>between and otherwise concerning</strong> the SEC and Reddit, Gamestop, Citadel, Robinhood, and Melvin Capital, including any and all communications and investigations revolving around Gamestop and GME. The SEC responded four days later, splitting my bulk request into five individual requests:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>21-01374-FOIA</strong>: for any and all documents, internal communications, communications, and complaints between the <em>SEC and Gamestop</em></li>
<li><strong>21-01375-FOIA</strong>: for any and all documents, internal communications, communications, and complaints between the <em>SEC and Citadel</em></li>
<li><strong>21-01376-FOIA</strong>: for any and all documents, internal communications, communications, and complaints between the <em>SEC and Robinhood</em></li>
<li><strong>21-01377-FOIA</strong>: for any and all documents, internal communications, communications, and complaints between the <em>SEC and Melvin Capital</em></li>
<li><strong>21-01378-FOIA</strong>: for any and all documents, internal communications, communications, and complaints between the <em>SEC and Reddit</em></li>
</ol>
<p>In the same response, I received a fee waiver (I was classified under the &ldquo;educational&rdquo; fee category, probably because I cited the purpose of my FOIA request was to gain and share valuable information regarding SEC&rsquo;s involvements in matters relevant to Gamestop investors. For the &ldquo;educational&rdquo; category, search and review services are free.) However, my request for an expedited process was denied, because I failed to demonstrate a &ldquo;compelling need&rdquo;. To quote from the letter they sent me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Compelling need&rdquo; means that a failure to obtain the requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to an individual&rsquo;s life or physical safety or, if the requester is primarily engaged in disseminating information, by demonstrating that an urgency to inform the public of actual or alleged Federal government activity exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, I disagreed. But I didn&rsquo;t disagree enough to bother with a lengthy appeal process, so I sucked it up.</p>
<p>​</p>
<h1 id="final-foia-responses">Final FOIA Responses</h1>
<p>Well, finally, after nearly two months, I received a final response on two of my five requests. I figured I&rsquo;d share them both with y&rsquo;all now, rather than wait for all five to come in, because god knows how much longer that&rsquo;ll take.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m a bit technologically inept, so I have no idea how to include the email PDFs as images within this text post. I&rsquo;ll downloaded them to <del>my google drive</del> Imgur and I&rsquo;ll add the links&ndash;hopefully you&rsquo;ll be able to access them that way. If the links don&rsquo;t work, let me know and I&rsquo;ll try to fix it. And if there&rsquo;s a better way to do it, please let me know. Giving you guys access to the links is mostly for verification purposes&ndash;I&rsquo;ll disseminate the main points within the letters in this post. Also, for privacy purposes, in the links I inked out my name and the name of the FOIA employees who processed the requests. Hope you guys don&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p>So, without further ado:</p>
<p>On May 19th, I received a final response regarding Request No. <strong>21-0177-FOIA</strong>. In this request, I asked for &ldquo;any and all documents, internal communications, communications, and complaints between the <strong>SEC and Melvin Capital</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This request was not &ldquo;denied&rdquo;, per say. The language used in the letter was &ldquo;withheld&rdquo;. In any case, the conclusion is the same: &lsquo;no, we&rsquo;re not going you these records.&rsquo; If you recall what I said above, this is legal under nine exemptions. The relevant exemptions they cited in the response&ndash;that is, the exemptions they&rsquo;re using to withhold the information from me in this case, are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;FOIA Exemption 3, which protects records or information that are specifically exempted from disclosure by statute. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 78u-6(h)(2)(A), the Commission shall not disclose any information, including information provided by a whistleblower to the Commission, which could reasonably be expected to reveal the identity of a whistleblower;</p>
<p>FOIA Exemption 6, which protects information the release of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</p>
<p>FOIA Exemption 7(A), which protects records or information when disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with law enforcement proceedings;</p>
<p>FOIA Exemption 7(C), which protects records or information when disclosure could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; and</p>
<p>FOIA Exemption 7(D), which protects records or information that could reasonably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential source.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My Immediate takeaways:</p>
<p>While it sucks that I&rsquo;ve been denied the information, even denial of information in of itself is informative. <strong>This is clear evidence that an investigation IS taking place into Melvin Capital. A whistleblower HAS stepped up, and has been verified enough to be protected.</strong></p>
<p>This is not proof that the SEC is investigating Melvin regarding it&rsquo;s involvement in GME. While that was the intent of my original request, if you remember, my bulk request was split into five individual requests, each regarding the SEC and one of five organizations (and any relevancy to Gamestop is no longer explicit). When reading the language used in this letter, there&rsquo;s no indication that the records being withheld have anything to do with an investigating into Melvin Capital <em>and Gamestop</em>. ONLY that Melvin is being investigated for <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>You can see the full letter here (I hope): <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Q8FX8yI">https://imgur.com/a/Q8FX8yI</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210521002417/https://imgur.com/a/Q8FX8yI">(wb)</a></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>On May 20th, I received a final response regarding Request No. <strong>21-01378-FOIA</strong>. In this request, I asked for &ldquo;any and all documents, internal communications, communications, and complaints between the <strong>SEC and Reddit</strong>&rdquo;. Keep in mind that this was nearly two months ago, when there was still a lot of talk about us and joint market manipulation, which, you know, was and still is fucking stupid.</p>
<p>Anyways, this letter is even more disappointing than the one about Melvin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;we conducted a thorough search of the SEC’s various systems of records, but did not locate or identify any information responsive to your request.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This feels&hellip;..misleading. There was a lot of talk about investigating Redditors for this whole debacle, no? Am I, like, being delusional? The SEC really has NOTHING about Reddit, or individual Redditors? No communications? No complaints?</p>
<p>I was very specific about my intentions in my request, but perhaps the SEC pulled a sneaky and deliberately re-phrased my request to be about records/communications/complaints <strong>between</strong> the SEC and Reddit as opposed to records/communications/complaints <strong>about</strong> Reddit. Which, in my unprofessional opinion, would be ridiculously shady. I don&rsquo;t have any evidence that this is what happened, but it&rsquo;s what makes the most sense to me at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>This letter is as inconclusive as it gets.</strong> I need some more time to think about it, though I&rsquo;m probably going to file an appeal. Your thoughts would be appreciated.</p>
<p>You can see the full letter here (I hope): <a href="https://imgur.com/a/d0MHRgc">https://imgur.com/a/d0MHRgc</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210521002417/https://imgur.com/a/d0MHRgc">(wb)</a></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep you guys updated as I get more responses. I imagine the other three regarding Citadel, Gamestop, and Robinhood are taking longer because there&rsquo;s a lot more for the FOIA people to comb through. <strong>Perhaps</strong> this in of itself is evidence that there&rsquo;s some juicy stuff going on here at the SEC. At this point, though, that&rsquo;s nothing more than educated conjecture.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! I know this was fucking long. Sorry about that. Your thoughts are appreciated.</p>
<p>And if TLDR: The SEC responded to my Freedom of Information Request to tell me that they can&rsquo;t disclose anything regarding Melvin in order to protect current law enforcement proceedings and the identity of a whistleblower/s. Further, no records, communications, complaints, and any and all other documents exist between the SEC and Reddit. That isn&rsquo;t to say nothing exists <strong>about</strong> Reddit, only <strong>between</strong> the SEC and Reddit. Semantics is everything in bureaucracy, so this is shady AF.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>EDIT + UPDATE: Changed Google Drive links to Imgur links. Also fixed a typo.</p>
<p>Thank you guys so much! I&rsquo;m really glad that you&rsquo;re all finding this information helpful.</p>
<p>After some discussion in the comments, I&rsquo;ve decided to call the FOIA employee in charge of my requests tomorrow to discuss the specific semantics about my request and how they interpreted it. I&rsquo;ll update this post afterwards to let y&rsquo;all know how it goes.</p>
<p>​</p>
<h1 id="update-2-boogaloo">UPDATE 2 BOOGALOO:</h1>
<p>Good morning Apes! Or afternoon, or evening.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience!</p>
<p>I spoke to the FOIA research specialist in charge of my Reddit and Melvin request. We’ll call her Ally, to help keep this update coherent—she was very thankful when I told her that I had redacted her name from the letters before posting them to Reddit, so please forgive me when I insist on using a pseudonym here on out.</p>
<p>I want to make one thing exceptionally clear: I’m being absolutely transparent in everything I tell you. I’ve gained some juicy confirmation today, and I’m going to leave nothing out. I’ve also made a few mistakes, and I’m going to tell you all of them. My goal here is to share everything I know, along with my opinions, and leave you to reach your own conclusions.</p>
<p>I called Ally this morning. Her office email and phone number were on the response letter. She was a real sweetheart and spoke to me for a full hour while I unloaded each of my questions in a hundred different ways. I continually rephrased my questions and mentally noted any discrepancies in her answers, so keep that in mind as I give you the general run-down.</p>
<p>I’ve got a lot to share with y’all, so please bear with me.</p>
<h1 id="my-original-request">MY ORIGINAL REQUEST</h1>
<p>First and foremost, a lot of you pointed out that the phrasing I used in my original request could have severely impacted the ultimate results. Unfortunately, I don’t have a copy of my original request on hand. FOIA requests for the SEC are submitted through a form on their website, and I wasn’t clever enough to save a screenshot before I hit submit on April 2nd.</p>
<p>On April 5th, I received a total of SIX emails—one that informed me that my bulk request would be split into five, and then five separate acknowledgement emails to confirm each individual request. (I didn’t include those in my original post because I honestly didn’t think they were relevant, but if y’all are interested, I don’t mind uploading them.)</p>
<p>I remembered that my original request was a bit more specific than the phrasing used on these letters, so the first thing I asked Alley was if she could send me a copy of my original request. She wasn’t sure what the proper procedures were and told me to email her about it and she would get back to me on Monday (I’ll be doing that after I post this). HOWEVER, she didn’t have any problem with reading my original request out loud. Bureaucracy, go figure.</p>
<p>My original request (verbatim to the best of my abilities—I’ll update this post when I finally receive a copy of my original request next week): “Any and all documents, internal communications, communications, and complaints between the SEC and Gamestop, Citadel, Robinhood, Melvin Capital, and Reddit, related to investigations of the manipulation or shorting of Gamestop security, repurchase and reverse re-purchase agreements, and treasury bonds.”</p>
<p>Time range: December 2018 to the present</p>
<p>So yes, unfortunately, I did use the word “between” rather than “about”. Theory discredited, idiocy confirmed.</p>
<p>Because I said “between”, the people searching the records narrowed their search to meet this criterion. So, it’s not necessarily that they deliberately withheld information using my specific wording as an excuse (ie, I only asked for X, so they’re only going to give me X and not a smidgen more), but that my specific wording acted as the boundary for the scope of the search (ie, I asked for X, so they only searched for X).</p>
<h1 id="the-three-biggies">THE THREE BIGGIES</h1>
<p>According to Ally, the three words/phrases that likely had the largest impact on my FOIA search were my use of:</p>
<ul>
<li>“between”</li>
<li>“Investigations”</li>
<li>“repurchase and reverse re-purchase agreements”</li>
</ul>
<p>Because I said “<strong>between</strong>”, it’s possible that they only searched the records and correspondences exchanged between the SEC and the specified companies. Any records and complaints (and Ally placed a large emphasis on complaints) ABOUT any of the five companies (again, Gamestop, Reddit, Robinhood, Citadel, and Melvin) would not <em>necessarily</em> appear in the search.</p>
<p>Because I said “investigations”, the search was narrowed to only include any records and information related to an <em>investigation</em>. Public and customer complaints unrelated to an investigation would not be included. Because the response to my FOIA request regarding Melvin Capital was a denial of records, I asked Ally if I could reasonably assume that it meant an investigation was, in fact, taking place. She said, “I cannot confirm nor deny”, (fucking duh), but at another point in the conversation she agreed that, <strong>given the reasons the SEC is denying access to these records, we can reasonably put together that an “inquiry” is “going on”.</strong> This is not phrased to be a guarantee, or a confirmation. But it’s pretty damning. She gave a similar response when I specifically asked if the mention of <strong>Exemption 3 can be interpreted to mean that a whistleblower exists.</strong></p>
<p>The third I found a bit odd. My request was a general request for any and all records “related to investigations of the manipulation or shorting of GME, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and treasury bonds”. (Remember I submitted this two months ago, when these were the hot topics on whatever subreddit we were using at the time). However, Ally kept emphasizing my use of the phrase “repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements”. Really, she kept going back to it, isolating this specific phrase from the rest. She said that if I submitted a new request without this specific phrase, it’s possible that I would receive a different result. She said that because I used this phrase, this is what the people “definitely” searched for. More, she said that with the search’s scope narrowed to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and treasury bonds, that’s probably why the final outcome of the request was a withholding of records.</p>
<p>It felt fucking odd that she kept emphasizing “repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements” as opposed to the other things in my request. I kept returning to this point, asking for clarifications, and she grew <em>very</em> careful in how she responded. I asked whether records would be denied if I hypothetically submitted a new request excluding that phrase. She said, enthusiastically, it “might”. She said there’s no guarantee. She said it would be “worth a shot”. She seemed encouraging, but at times overly hesitant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to properly convey tone over text. So I’ll tell you that, <em>personally</em>, through a mix of Ally’s tone, the conversation’s content, and my own internal speculation, the vibe I’m getting is that the records regarding Melvin were denied because of an existing and ongoing investigation related to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. This is speculation. Make of it what you will.</p>
<p>At the very least, this means that all five requests are, in fact, still related in some way to GME, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and/or treasury bonds.</p>
<h1 id="where-are-the-wells">WHERE ARE THE WELLS???</h1>
<p>I asked Ally about exemption 4 and 9, because there was some interest in the comments.</p>
<p>Regarding exemption 4, Ally said that it’s mainly used when someone is trying to get trade secrets, how a company operates, their financial information, that might be covered under a confidential order.</p>
<p>When I asked about exemption 9, she laughed and exclaimed ‘are you kidding me!’ Apparently, for <em>some</em> reason, and I can’t possibly imagine why, the SEC doesn’t exercise exemption 9 very often. In fact, Ally hasn’t seen it happen once in the past 15 years. The FOIA and its exemptions are standard across every U.S federal agency, so it’s an exemption designed for other agencies that regulate geological land, land use, “things like that”. She said that if you guys are interested, you can check out the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/oip/oip-guidance">Department of Justice Office of Information Guidance</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210521193624/https://www.justice.gov/oip/oip-guidance">(wb)</a> for the history of each exemption.</p>
<h1 id="moving-forward">MOVING FORWARD</h1>
<p>Obviously, I’m still waiting on the other three requests. They are being processed by a different employee. Ally gave me her contact information and I might reach out next week for an update.</p>
<p>Alley gave me advice on how I should phrase my request in the event that I decide to appeal or submit a new one. I will definitely be submitting a new one, taking her advice to be much broader in scope. I’ll also be using this post to support my argument for an expedited process, as the number of upvotes clearly demonstrates a large public interest in the existence of “actual or alleged Federal government activity”. We’ll see if it’s enough.</p>
<h1 id="my-take-aways-and-tldr">MY TAKE-AWAYS (and TLDR)</h1>
<p>Obviously, I fucked up when I submitted these requests. I always say, hindsight is a beautiful bastard. That being said, these requests are still substantial, and the responses are tremendously valuable.</p>
<p>We now know that records that meet the criteria of my request <strong>exist</strong> between the SEC and Melvin Capital. (If they didn’t exist, then the FOIA response letter would have simply said that no records were found, like it did with my request regarding Reddit.) These records are related to an <strong>investigation</strong> and the existence of a <strong>whistleblower</strong> (as can be extrapolated from the exemptions exercised in the SEC’s withholding of its records.) You can choose to look at it as strong conjecture, but I personally see this as an <strong>indirect, yet official confirmation.</strong> The SEC deliberately selected these exemptions as the reasons behind its refusal to release its records. It even went above and beyond to describe exemption 3 as related to the identity of a whistleblower, when exemptions 7 A, C, and D were almost copied and pasted. The SEC wouldn’t mention protecting a whistleblower in this letter if there was no whistleblower to protect.</p>
<p>This investigation and whistleblower is related to either the shortselling of Gamestop security, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and/or treasury bonds.</p>
<p>Reddit, as an organization, is not currently being federally investigated for anything related to the manipulation of GME, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, or treasury bonds.</p>
<p>The <em>real</em> conjecture imo is whether this all means that Melvin, or an employee within Melvin, is the whistleblower, since the scope of this request was strictly on records and communications <em>between</em> the SEC and Melvin. Now <em>that’s</em> some tinfoil-hat soup I can get behind.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>Fuck this was long. Sorry if this update was a bit messy. I wrote the whole thing with a cat on my lap and a million other responsibilities looming over my shoulder. I wish I could take more time to properly organize this, maybe condense it, but I’m a bit pressed for time and I want to get this out as soon as possible. I’ll respond to your comments as I can, though I won’t be active later tonight or all of tomorrow.</p>
<p>I’ll make new posts for the other requests as the final responses come in. Hopefully they’ll be just as juicy as the one regarding Melvin.</p>
<p>Holy shit, thank you guys so much for all of your support, and for taking the time to read through all of this. I hope that I can take advantage of the traction that this post has gotten to convince the SEC’s FOIA department to expedite my new request, but I’m keeping my expectations tame.</p>
<p>Have a fantastic weekend, Apes!</p>
