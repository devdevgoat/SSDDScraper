<h1 id="guys-i-cant-believe-some-of-you-still-dont-understandthis-will-moon-when-and-only-when-there-is-a-forced-buyback">Guys I can&rsquo;t believe some of you still dont understand.This will moon when AND ONLY WHEN there is a forced buyback</h1>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p><strong>How to achieve forced buyback?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Share recall</li>
<li>Margin call</li>
<li>Small raw buying pressure to push unhedged new options ITM so that hedging provides &lsquo;free&rsquo; upward movement on TACTICAL MOMENTS ONLY.</li>
<li>Forced liquidation by DTCC</li>
<li>Hard intervention by the SEC</li>
</ol>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>Unless one of these happens, the price can go anywhere&hellip;. and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s $200 or $40 a share&hellip;</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p><strong>Red days dont mean the squeeze is off, green days dont mean the squeeze is on. The price is fucking irrelevant (unless you&rsquo;re buying, then big red days are something to celebrate)</strong></p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>You should stop caring. We&rsquo;ve been saying this for months, but everytime we have a green day you guys want to celebrate and cheer because &ldquo;where lambo&rdquo; like a bunch of spoiled children. And on red days you freak out way too much.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re setting yourself up for constant disappointment which will paperhand you and ruin this for yourself. Yesterday I told you not to overcelebrate and I was told to fuck off and not ruin the fun. See where the &lsquo;harmless fun&rsquo; yesterday got you? Totally (and without good reason) disappointed today.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p><strong>Get fucking patient</strong></p>
<p>For those 5 catalysts that I listed there are many things &lsquo;in the works&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The DTCC is spewing new regulations like a toddler that ate too much icecream.</p>
<p>There is a shareholder vote 9th of June, GME hasn&rsquo;t released what we&rsquo;ll be voting on however.</p>
<p>SEC just got a new head that is known to be anti hedgefund bullshit.</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p><strong>What IS important?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Buy if you can. This determines how much exposure you have once we moon. More shares is more tendies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HOLD. Seriously. Don&rsquo;t daytrade, don&rsquo;t sell. Just hold. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if we&rsquo;re down 50% or up 40%. Stop giving a shit. This will only moon if there are not enough shares to go around. By holding, you are taking your shares and you&rsquo;re saying &ldquo;These are mine now. Less to go around&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop fucking promising yourselves dates. Especially if you&rsquo;re smoothbrained. Don&rsquo;t get excited at all. Stop it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<p><strong>Not fucking advice, go ahead and be stupid if you think that&rsquo;s better</strong></p>
<p>‚Äã</p>
<h1 id="you-dumb-apes-want-to-hear-a-secret-max-pain-is-at-150-">you dumb apes want to hear a secret? Max pain is at 150 ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h1>
<p>Long whales are going to defend that point to bleed large option owners. You know who owns lots of options? People who needed to buy them to reset FTDs and huge short positions. That&rsquo;s who.</p>
<p>We will hover around 150 all day and that is a good thing for us. &ldquo;Red bad, green good&rdquo; is such an ape-unworthy simpleminded approach to this. Grow some wrinkles for gods sake. Do you want $200 as a price today if that helps shorts by letting them make a shitload of money on options? If you&rsquo;re saying yes then you&rsquo;re seriously almost a real ape.</p>
<p><strong>Smart apes know that to win the war you don&rsquo;t have to win every battle. You have to win key battles.</strong></p>
