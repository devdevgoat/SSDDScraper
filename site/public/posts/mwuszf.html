<li>u/broccaaa has posted a follow-up to his earlier post about trying to detect hidden FTDs with machine learning. It outlines the method behind his data labeling and the AI architecture. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwrycd/how_to_train_a_binary_classifier_ai_to_detect/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwrycd/how_to_train_a_binary_classifier_ai_to_detect/</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210423100802/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwrycd/how_to_train_a_binary_classifier_ai_to_detect/">(wb)</a></li>
<li>The proxy filing is encouraging voting to happen quickly - this wasn&rsquo;t in previous filings by Gamestop. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwmgne/important_im_sure_everyone_has_seen_that_the/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwmgne/important_im_sure_everyone_has_seen_that_the/</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210423034011/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwmgne/important_im_sure_everyone_has_seen_that_the/">(wb)</a> <strong>EDIT:</strong> u/ColCrabs <strong>claims that it was in the 2020 filing, page 9</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwuszf/actually_useful_info_you_might_have_missed_230421/gvkuwn4/?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwuszf/actually_useful_info_you_might_have_missed_230421/gvkuwn4/?context=3</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210423155733/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwuszf/actually_useful_info_you_might_have_missed_230421/gvkuwn4/">(wb)</a></li>
<li>People were speculating about some random shitcoin being pumped to fake the amount of collateral a fund had on hand - some has pointed out that the price is only seen on one very low volume exchange, and this is just a general crypto scam, not anything to do with us. It&rsquo;s unlikely a bank would view it as valid collateral. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwhqwu/the_truth_about_capital_x_coin/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwhqwu/the_truth_about_capital_x_coin/</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210423010547/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwhqwu/the_truth_about_capital_x_coin/">(wb)</a></li>
<li>The free float is lower than previously thought (now around 25m), going by the numbers in the proxy filing. It appears that institutional ownership has grown. I can&rsquo;t speak for the accuracy of the 25m shares held by retail, as I haven&rsquo;t checked how that was calculated. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwgyfw/free_float_is_267_million_didnt_count_cohen_twice/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwgyfw/free_float_is_267_million_didnt_count_cohen_twice/</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210423001638/https://i.redd.it/1pqbq8iuzsu61.jpg">(wb)</a></li>
<li>A user claims that BlackRock and other institutions who were lending out their shares on the 15th of April do not have the right to vote at the shareholder meeting. I think it would be worth checking, if at all possible, what the lending numbers actually looked like on the 15th. Were they unusually low? In that case, could BlackRock still have the right to vote? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwj1ko/clarification_on_gamestop_record_date_shares/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwj1ko/clarification_on_gamestop_record_date_shares/</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210423014743/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwj1ko/clarification_on_gamestop_record_date_shares/">(wb)</a>. <strong>EDIT:</strong> u/Spiaa <strong>claims the filing explicitly states that BlackRock can vote on their shares:</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwuszf/actually_useful_info_you_might_have_missed_230421/gvkgusd/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwuszf/actually_useful_info_you_might_have_missed_230421/gvkgusd/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210423141439/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwuszf/actually_useful_info_you_might_have_missed_230421/gvkgusd/">(wb)</a></li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve seen reports that $2m has been spent on $300 puts with an expiration date of today. Could do with someone verifying, but I have no reason to not believe my source (someone in the Unusual Whales discord) - basically, two people have made a very large bet on the stock doing <em>something</em> today. u/welcometosilentchill claims this is a bearish sign, whereas u/Blussi claims it&rsquo;s a bullish one. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwuszf/actually_useful_info_you_might_have_missed_230421/gvkgxyx/?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwuszf/actually_useful_info_you_might_have_missed_230421/gvkgxyx/?context=3</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210423141511/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwuszf/actually_useful_info_you_might_have_missed_230421/gvkgxyx/">(wb)</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwuszf/actually_useful_info_you_might_have_missed_230421/gvkmkql/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwuszf/actually_useful_info_you_might_have_missed_230421/gvkmkql/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210423145812/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwuszf/actually_useful_info_you_might_have_missed_230421/gvkmkql/">(wb)</a></li>

<p><strong>There are probably countless more good posts that I missed. If you saw any in the last day or two that are worth looking at, please comment them and give a quick outline for people.</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do our best to actively fight forum sliding and topic dilution by remaining on-topic. Mods, please do your best to keep the sub clean.</p>
<p>P.S: This isn&rsquo;t something I plan on doing every/most days - for the people who do do the morning news round up things, I think I speak for a lot of us when I say a more straightforward layout of the research and the findings like this would be preferable to a couple of confused sentences and then a giant 1000x1000px cringe meme</p>
<p>P.P.S: Please upvote the people linking research in the comments moreso than people saying thank you :D I appreciate it, but the point of this was to collect the substantial stuff</p>
<p>P.P.P.S: The reaction to this post is honestly pretty strange - I had a huge number of awards come in on relatively few comments and upvotes. Now the post is doing really well, but I go and check the first thing I linked and it only has 196 upvotes. What gives? I&rsquo;m wondering if I&rsquo;ve accidentally included misinfo on here that someone wants people to see. Be critical about everything I&rsquo;ve written.</p>
