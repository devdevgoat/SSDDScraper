			<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Now that the we are just 7 days away from the shareholder&rsquo;s meeting scheduled for 6/9 I wanted to share some thoughts on what we can possibly expect from the meeting itself.</p>
<p>Gamestop confirmed the meeting for 6/9 at 11am EST and will conclude at 11:15 EST. Dont expect any big announcements during the meeting especially since its only 15 minutes. What usually happens in these meetings is the company will announce the PRELIMINARY results to the proxy vote. They wont announce the vote count because it simply wont be finalized yet by then (more to come on that later) they will know which items passed the vote and what didnt and thats pretty much all they will tell us. After announcing prelim results of the vote I would expect Sherman to have a few closing comments maybe hype up the earnings later that day but thats pretty much it. Remember the meeting is only 15 minutes. Link to announcement below</p>
<p><a href="https://investor.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-2021-earnings-release">https://investor.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-2021-earnings-release</a></p>
<p>So your probably thinking what about the vote count and when will we get those juicy numbers? Well I looked back at last year&rsquo;s meeting and what they did was 4 business days AFTER the meeting Gamestop filed a form 8-K with the SEC disclosing the finalized voting numbers which I linked below. I also took a screen shot of the most relevant part which is Gamestop announcing over 42 million votes tallied for a total of 66.4% voter turnout. So this is the filing we will all be waiting for and we know this year voter turnout will be much closer to 100% with votes counts potentially reaching the 100s of millions. And for that very reason we will probably see a delay longer than 4 business days for when final voter results are released.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/349495b7-542f-4501-921c-320746dabbba">https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/349495b7-542f-4501-921c-320746dabbba</a></p>

<p>So now that we know not to expect the vote count at the shareholders meeting and that it will likely by delayed by at least 4 business days expect Citadel and friends to take advantage of this. They know our tits are jacked and that we are beyond hyped to get the voting results so they could use this delay to launch another major short attack. If the numbers are as bad as we are speculating then this is likely their last chance to shake as many paper hands as they can before Ryan Cohen drops the potential nuclear bomb that is the voting results.</p>
<p>In short (TLDR) Dont expect voting results at the meeting or any big announcements for that matter. Final vote counts last year took 4 business days to release this year could be the same. Buy, Hold, Vote.</p>
<p>EDIT: u/warheadhs pointed out that the 8-K is due 4 business days after the meeting so it wont be later than that. Still expect hedgefund fookery</p>
<p>EDIT 2: u/humanslime shared a great table showing all the voting results from past years and wanted to include <a href="https://i.imgur.com/liOka98.png">https://i.imgur.com/liOka98.png</a></p>
<p>EDIT 3: u/greysweatseveryday made a good point that gamestop will know the final results at the meeting because the votes would have already been counted. I agree with this but when looking at last year where the election was a contested one and very close for that matter the actual vote numbers weren&rsquo;t shared at the meeting. Whatever Gamestop ends up doing this year dont be disappointed if vote numbers aren&rsquo;t shared until the 8-K filing</p>
<p>EDIT 4: Some of you in the comments pointed out that Wes in the AMA today mentioned that share counts can easily be fudged or swept under the rug if they exceed existing share amount. Dont pin your hopes on exuberant vote counts if thats the case!</p>
<p>EDIT 5: A lot of you have been asking what about other announcements like new CEO, NFT, crypto div, ect. These can literally be announced at anytime. While its possible they might have a something extra to announce at the share holders meeting I would think it&rsquo;s more likely we get something at the earnings call instead later hat day at 5pm EST. Remember Gamestop has been making most of their recent announcements either before or after market close and earnings call is after hours. IF NO ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE MADE THEN WE JUST SIMPLY CONTINUE TO BUY AND HOLD SIMPLE AS THAT.</p>
