			<p>April 9 update: This piece has been heavily edited from its original presentation. I&rsquo;ve had plenty of shit talk about this post. I get it. Some of y&rsquo;all think I&rsquo;m fucking r*tarded for even posting this. But NOT ALL APES HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE JANUARY. I&rsquo;m just trying to help in my limited capacity. And it seems to have helped thousands of apes get their affairs in order before liftoff, so I stand by this post. To be so smart as to correct me (rudely), you rude ones sure don&rsquo;t know how to read my disclaimers scattered all over this post 🧐 plus we figured out a record date in real time. Winning.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: I CAN&rsquo;T EDIT THE TITLE BUT HOLY SHIT GUYS ITS LOOKING LIKE <a href="http://imgur.com/a/QJqwTfw">4/15</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210408205943/https://imgur.com/a/QJqwTfw">(wb)</a> RECORD DATE NOT 4/20 I THINK WE FIGURED IT OUT GOOD JOB APES</strong></p>
<p>WE NOW HAVE <a href="img/imgur_q99378.gif">PROOF</a> OF TDA SAYING RECORD DATE APRIL 15, 2021</p>

<p>TO ANSWER MY OWN QUESTION IDFK THE CATALYST NONE OF US DO. I&rsquo;M NOT SAYING 4/20 IS ANYTHING BESIDES A (SUSPECTED) DEADLINE FOR RECALLING SHARES</p>
<p>The more shares recalled, the more the shorts need to cover!!</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9eqv9/clarifying_share_recall_what_is_it_and_how_does/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">lenders are responsible for recalling shares, not Gamestop!!!</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210408143657/https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9eqv9/clarifying_share_recall_what_is_it_and_how_does/">(wb)</a></p>
<p>Comments are reporting that cash users with TDA and Fidelity do NOT lend out their shares. You will be notified more about voting through their platform when it&rsquo;s time. More brokerage updates from users in comments, but I would suggest you contact your broker yourself. Stay vigilant! Many brokers are automatic margin!!</p>
<p>Posting this before us 🦧 breed confusion&hellip; I know the <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/gHBIpHq">memes</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210408153949/http://imgur.com/gallery/gHBIpHq">(wb)</a> are exciting, but they open lots of questions. I’m here to open my limited knowledge as well as start a discussion on what this means. Directly quoting u/Obvious_Shake_5012 here also.</p>
<p>So a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mmcgb6/got_this_email_back_from_rh_about_gme_shareholder/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">post</a>  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210407212942/https://i.redd.it/kkmrwgiiktr61.jpg">(wb)</a> on here shows a letter from Robinhood acknowledging a Gamestop Share Record date of 4/20. I contacted my main broker (I use several cuz I don’t trust a bitch) TD Ameritrade by phone and they confirmed this deadline for me.</p>
<p>What does it mean, Pink?!</p>
<p>The date of record, in this case <del>4/20</del> 4/15, is the deadline for shorts to return their shares. So a recall would be BEFORE 4/15 because 4/15 is the RECORD DATE . I.E Recall is NOW!</p>
<p>Did you read that, apes? THE DATE THE SHARES MUST BE RETURNED TO LENDERS BY SHORTS, VERIFIED AND ACCOUNTED FOR TO RECORD <strong>YOUR</strong> SHARES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO VOTE IN THE SHAREHOLDER MEETING.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR SHARES</strong>. This is UP TO US!</p>
<p>⚠️ <strong>Contact your brokers and RECALL YOUR SHARES!! Tell them you want to exercise your shareholder rights in the upcoming shareholder meeting.</strong> ⚠️</p>
<p><em>Do not fear the shills in the comments saying this is market manipulation or planned movement. None of that shit flies here, and all I&rsquo;m saying is that you need to recall your shares before a certain deadline to exercise your shareholder right to vote. Nothing illegal about that!</em></p>
<p>Keep in mind, Gamestop would need to have the 69.75 Mil shares accounted for (or however many are recalled) before shareholders can vote for anything important.</p>
<p>No this isn&rsquo;t a guarantee that anything will happen. But from a marketing standpoint, I sure as hell wouldn&rsquo;t be sending out PR without knowing for a fact things will be kosher enough to conduct business by the meeting date on <strong>6/9 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</strong></p>
<p>Inb4 naysayers say institutional whales don’t historically recall their shares and/or participate as voting shareholders in the annual meeting. WELL THIS YEAR IS FUCKING DIFFERENT HAS ANY OTHER YEAR BEEN THIS HISTORICALLY FUCKED?!</p>
<p>But just in case it <em>does</em> go according to historical trend&hellip;</p>
<p>Share recalls like to spark gamma squeezes.</p>
<p>If shares are required for a shareholder vote, Gamestop will send public notice this Friday or Monday as this is 60 days before the meeting date. Who knows what will come of this.</p>
<p><strong>These dates are factual and documented as far as I can tell, I am not making up my own target date or claiming anything here. Stay vigilant and do your own research!</strong></p>
<p><strong>4/20 BLAZE IT BITCHES</strong>🔥🌬💨💨💨🌳🌳🌳🌳</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes you can still sell your shares if they are recalled. This simply means nobody is being &ldquo;loaned&rdquo; your shares. (To then take to the pawn shop like our boy Kenny G does.)</li>
<li>You must be a current shareholder as of the record date to vote.</li>
<li>We don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re voting on yet, but im exercising my right to vote.</li>
<li>TDAmeritrade confirmed my shares are not leant out and I will be able to participate in the annual shareholders meeting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Copied from a comment cuz I couldn&rsquo;t remember:</p>
<p>The notification will be through TDAmeritrade and will show up under &ldquo;My Account &ndash;&gt; Shareholder Library&rdquo;</p>
