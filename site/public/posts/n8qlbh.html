<p>Gherkinit here with another look forward at upcoming technical events, market fuckery, and some spectrum colored crayons.</p>
<p>This week I want to go over upcoming technical indicators and take a look at some things I&rsquo;ve noticed happening over this last week, such as, disappearing volume, lying little boys from Bulgaria, and the apparent effects of inflationary naked short selling.</p>
<p>As always later tonight I will post a consolidated Video DD of this on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PickleFinancial">YouTube</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PickleFinancial">(wb)</a> for those of you that don&rsquo;t have the time to read through this.</p>
<p>Edit 1* Tomorrow before 6pm Eastern.*</p>
<h1 id="part-i-wedges-indicators-and-charts">Part I: Wedges, Indicators, and Charts</h1>
<p><strong>Section A: The Pennant, MOAW, or big ol' titz jackin' triangle</strong></p>
<p>First thing first the one everyone is always asking about the previous descending wedge/bull pennant indicator that we have been looking at for 2 weeks now. This formation was adjusted after the week of 5/3-5/7 as I believed there was a false breakout due to GME&rsquo;s market valuation being fundamentally changed by the sale of 3.5M shares at $157. This week the price broke out and appears to be using the upper resistance of the wedge as support. Here is where it is currently on the 4-Hour chart.</p>
<p><img src="../img/fv2tuf8378y61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The floor of 157 proved mostly true this week as we only went below it briefly on the intraday Tuesday and Thursday. We did not stay below for long. I continue to see 157 as being a very strong support trend moving forward as I believe the buy side is actively looking to purchase under that price point.</p>
<p>Since the shorts are so fond of kicking the can down the road, I don&rsquo;t see why they should have all the fun. I don&rsquo;t want to change the fundamentals of the pennant but do realize it can be more accurate. So let me introduce you smooth brains to the logarithmic scale chart.</p>
<p>Without going to much into log scale and why it&rsquo;s used, I will say the manner in which it shows data is better for a stock like GME that has undergone drastic changes in price over the period we are viewing and thus presents a more accurate view of technical indicators.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about log vs. linear, check out <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/logvslinear.asp">this</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210410231751/https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/logvslinear.asp">(wb)</a> article.</p>
<p>So here is the same pennant, drawn at the same angle on a log chart.</p>
<p><img src="../img/3ie9ymt678y61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This ever so slightly adjusts the end point showing the peak at 5:30pm Wednesday. <strong>This is the absolute last time this is going to be changed/adjusted</strong>. I truly think this is the most accurate representation of this pennant I can create. So where do we breakout? Let&rsquo;s look</p>
<p><img src="../img/5t1mj9c978y61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So we have upper and lower channel breakout points upper will occur if we trade above 162.50 and the lower below $162.50 but above $157. I believe after this breakout point that short sale value will have dried up and the cost to borrow will become greater than the value of shorting, this could be the catalyst.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go deeper into this later for now more indicators&hellip;.</p>
<p><strong>Section B: MACD</strong></p>
<p>This is the current state of MACD, everyone&rsquo;s favorite trend-following momentum indicator. It looks like we are teetering on either crossing over on increased volume to the upside, or continuing a downtrend as the signal line and MACD diverge.</p>
<p><img src="../img/05d64smb78y61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We could get one more red day, then see a crossover on Tuesday to the upside. Mirroring the previous green pattern.</p>
<p><img src="../img/y792cele78y61.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Section C: TTM Squeeze</strong></p>
<p>TTM Squeeze is a volume and volatility indicator. We are looking for 5 or more fire signals on the daily to indicate a possible upside move in the near future. We Have 7 this is a pretty good sign that we can expect a decent amount of upwards momentum this week.</p>
<p><img src="../img/yp393ejg78y61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Also the upper Bollinger band has crossed into the Keltner channel here</p>
<p><img src="../img/affxf6ii78y61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This lends more credence to the TTM squeeze signals. More info <a href="https://trendspider.com/blog/how-to-trade-ttm-squeeze-indicator/">here</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210509235805/https://trendspider.com/blog/how-to-trade-ttm-squeeze-indicator/">(wb)</a>.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>Section D: Technical Conclusion TLDR</strong></p>
<p>Everything is still looking bullish going into this week.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of downward pressure on the stock these last two weeks but I believe it will not take much upward pressure for this to take off we are definitely closing in on the endgame.</p>
<p>I expect we will see some interesting things happening this week as we break the pennant, TTM squeeze is set to move, and MACD looks ripe for a reversal.</p>
<h1 id="part-ii-gherkinits-inflation-theory-and-wardens-obv-theory">Part II: Gherkinit&rsquo;s Inflation Theory and Warden&rsquo;s OBV Theory</h1>
<p>I wanted to talk about something I noticed looking into u/WardenElite&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5me5g/the_mother_of_all_wedges_an_endgame_dd_technical/">DD</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210516040711/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5me5g/the_mother_of_all_wedges_an_endgame_dd_technical/">(wb)</a> this week on OBV, and his thesis that OBV is technically trending up. How this ties into my own thesis from my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mx8nit/whats_coming_some_dd_for_the_week_of_4262143021/">DD</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210424022022/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mx8nit/whats_coming_some_dd_for_the_week_of_4262143021/">(wb)</a> on 4/25/21.</p>
<p>The thesis I proposed was that due to the large number of synthetic short shares sold on to the market without being covered that the short shares themselves had taken on an inflationary nature. So similar to the dollar. Whenever the Fed prints more dollars each dollar in existence becomes less valuable because the total number of dollars in existence increases. This is dilution. Plain and simple.</p>
<p>In my previous DD I explained how I saw that short volume sold was having less of an effect over time.</p>
<p>More short volume sold = less change in price of the stock.</p>
<p>I believe much like in my dollar value example, they have simply counterfeited to many short shares and now each share is worth significantly less.</p>
<p>I think warden&rsquo;s post earlier this week confirms my theory as OBV is becoming unaffected by what the data shows to be ever increasing short pressure. So previously they were able to tank the price and now they are selling 59%+ of our daily volume short and the price is staying the same</p>
<p><img src="../img/7kl674rk78y61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the effective price change from all that shorting</p>
<p><img src="../img/m9dr06xm78y61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We are up 6.57%&hellip;</p>
<p>I want that to sink in</p>
<p>So I think this inflationary nature of these short positions is getting to the point were they can in fact no longer keep the price down. Meaning Warden and I have come to similar conclusions with different data (separately, we have not colluded on this) that end of his wedge or my pennant (doesn&rsquo;t matter) signifies the point at which they can no longer keep the price stable.</p>
<p>My theory is that the value of long positions, as there are so few of them available, is enough of a catalyst to push the price up.</p>
<p>Remember if the price surges, FOMO kicks in, and then margins will be called.</p>
<h1 id="part-iii-why-so-short-or-lenders-fuk-hedges">Part III: Why so short? or Lender&rsquo;s Fuk Hedges?</h1>
<p>This part is speculative but I think it makes sense and the conclusions add up. In my experience, that&rsquo;s usually a good place to start.</p>
<p><strong>Why keep making or buying these synthetic shares?</strong></p>
<p>If they are in fact losing the ability to net a positive change for the short side why keep compounding the problem?&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Incentive.</strong></p>
<p>I was looking through the Dave Lauer AMA and he kept mentioning rebates. I don&rsquo;t typically go short stocks except through options and I don&rsquo;t use margin. So this is only something I vaguely remembered from school and had to embarrassingly look up.</p>
<p>Basically any time you short a stock you borrow the share from a lender and you pay a stock loan fee</p>
<p><em><strong>value of securities borrowed X number of days borrowed X agreed rate/number of days in the year = Stock Loan Fee</strong></em></p>
<p>In addition you must post collateral of:</p>
<p><em><strong>value of securities borrowed X the agreed margin = stock loan collateral</strong></em></p>
<p>This collateral can be non-cash (eg other liquid equities or government bonds) or you can post cash collateral.</p>
<p><strong>Now here is what intrigued me.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes in certain arrangements with larger investors a lender will offer a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-loan-rebate.asp">rebate</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210127145949/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-loan-rebate.asp">(wb)</a> for using cash collateral. These rebates are a payment on interest or earnings for the cash held to cover collateral from the lender to the borrower. This rebate typically can offset all or some of the lender&rsquo;s fees to the borrower depending on the Securities Lending Agreement between the two parties.</p>
<p><strong>So how does all this tie into GME?</strong></p>
<p>The first thing that got me looking into this was a question I get five times a day on my stream, at least.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Why is the borrow rate on GME so low?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>GME has a ludicrously low borrow rate for a stock that has as much short interest (as shown above) as it does, currently 0.94%. Other stocks with I suspect are significantly less short (eg AMC: 26.64%,KOSS: 90.80%) have much higher borrow fees than GME.</p>
<p>This led me to the thought</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;What if it was in the lenders best interest to keep the rate as low as possible to incentivize SHFs (short hedge funds) to continue shorting the stock ?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>It could be if the lenders can make it lucrative for the SHFs to short why would they stop so I started building a scenario in my head what if the deal looks something like this.</p>
<p><img src="../img/i5b4ttep78y61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So the lender lays out a deal where simply by posting the cash collateral the SHF is able to short the stock at no fee while earning the interest or profits off the cash held in collateral. This incentivizes the SHF to continue shorting the stock as the are making profits while accumulating larger and larger short positions. While the Lender accrues more and more collateral.</p>
<p>The more cash held the higher the interest payment and the more short they can be on GME. In this scenario they are essentially being paid to short the stock.</p>
<p><strong>Sounds like the deal of a lifetime. So, what&rsquo;s in it for the lender?</strong></p>
<p>Well if I were a lender for a SHF I would have intimate knowledge of what their positions looked like. I would also know that when they extended their positions instead of closing the loans they were at risk of defaulting. If they default I keep their collateral.</p>
<p><strong>Why would I only want some of their collateral when I found a way to have it all.</strong></p>
<p>Well for this to work the hedge funds would have to be trapped in a cycle of shorting, a lost position with no way out.</p>
<p><em>We will pick this back up in a minute.</em></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>This week I hit the front page with an albeit inflammatory post, I still contend it had merit and I am going to show you why I don&rsquo;t think the hedges ever covered. This was essentially what I posted about.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/duplicates/n6i28o/did_vlad_do_a_perjury/">When a little boi from bulgaria does a fibby</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/duplicates/n6i28o/did_vlad_do_a_perjury/">(wb)</a></p>
<p>So Vlad is a liar, what&rsquo;s new? Why not sideways talk your way out of it? Why didn&rsquo;t he stall? How come none of the 10+ people in that room stopped him?</p>
<p>Well, they thought they could sell the narrative. That things went wrong during unforeseen market action, they had to cover, they lost money and they were sorry. I think they assumed since the price was sitting at $40.69 retail would buy it too, bag holders would eat their losses and learn their lessons, selling out of their positions, and business would go on as usual.</p>
<p>I got a lot of comments this week as to the inflammatory nature of my post. I wrote it in a rush and I didn&rsquo;t back up my point. For this I apologized and I will do so again. It has never been my intention to misinform this community.</p>
<p>But starting this DD this week I accidentally looked at something that I hadn&rsquo;t for a while, <strong>I zoomed out</strong>. when compiling data for my log-scale charts I realized something.</p>
<p><strong>We didn&rsquo;t realize how fuk the shorts were because we weren&rsquo;t looking at the big picture.</strong></p>
<p><img src="../img/4wfb7l9s78y61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>By the looks of the OBV (thanks! u/WardenElite) they had a pretty successful run of shorting from October 2015 to July of 2020 and then the stock started to climb slowly. They definitely continued to short during the period from July -Dec 2020 reaching the short interest they did in January of 143% short. I think that the slow creep from $3 in July to $20 in December locked in their positions that they had been building for <strong>five years</strong> and the run up in January cemented it.</p>
<p>If they shorted at $3 and the price was twenty that represents a 566.67% Loss</p>
<p>At Friday&rsquo;s price of $161.11 that loss would be 5270.33%</p>
<h1 id="part-iv-one-neat-little-package">Part IV: One Neat Little Package</h1>
<p>So I am gonna attempt to tie all this together I may be wrong about some things I will update throughout the week.</p>
<p>My theory is, they never covered not only because they couldn&rsquo;t, but also because the lenders have been incentivizing them to continue shorting through profitable rebate agreements that allow them to short the stock infinitely.</p>
<p>What the lenders, I believe, realized is that the were trapped in the positions they had no option but to continue shorting the stock hoping the interest would die down and retail would back out.</p>
<p>The Lenders took advantage of their &ldquo;trapped&rdquo; positions by structuring deals that would help them continually short the stock at the cost of cash collateral. The lenders win either way either off the profit of the borrowed shares or accruing collateral on loans that were guaranteed to default.</p>
<p><strong>The lenders are lending synthetic shares because they know that in the event of a default it won&rsquo;t matter, because the shares will be diluted along with the rest of the assets.</strong> (Sound familiar? It should the lenders are doing to the SHFs, what the SHFs are doing to GameStop)</p>
<p>The only missing piece of this,</p>
<p><strong>Do lenders pay taxes on seized collateral from a defaulted loan?</strong></p>
<p>Finally, I am starting to think we aren&rsquo;t waiting for a squeeze</p>
<p><strong>we are in the middle of one</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="../img/5dkw4pcv78y61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where my heads at right now&hellip;</p>
<p>I have been writing this for hours I&rsquo;m jackkked to the titz! But my eyes are sleepy. Let me know if there is anything I didn&rsquo;t tie together and let me know if there is anything I left out. I will be editing this over the rest of the night.</p>
<p>TLDR; Read it, it&rsquo;s a lot&hellip;</p>
<p>Thank you all in advance for you support! This community has been super amazing hope this doesn&rsquo;t disappoint.</p>

<p>Edit 1: I&rsquo;m so sorry to those of you waiting for the Video DD. I will not be able to do it till after the stream tomorrow. This write-up took up all of my day besides Mother&rsquo;s day stuff. I promise it will be available by 6pm EST tomorrow.</p>
