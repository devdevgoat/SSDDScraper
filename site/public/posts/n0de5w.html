			<p>This post probably will get down vote to oblivion but fk it, I can&rsquo;t be the only one feel like this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been with GME since October last year and seeing how the og of this play versus now is kind of scary to say the least.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t as early as DFV or Cohen but I got in because I make bet based on people and after literally watching every RC&rsquo;s interview and reading every article I went all in. The group that was into GME back then was much smaller so that&rsquo;s why it caught Wallstreet off guard. The current state is way fking different.</p>
<p>Everything we do is being monitored, we&rsquo;re in the light they&rsquo;re in the dark. It&rsquo;s great that we share knowledge about the market and how crooked these hedges are but remember to always double check, just because someone do a DD doesn&rsquo;t mean they are correct (I don&rsquo;t care who they are). A lot of you who so impatient is because you TRULY did not understand this play and just following blindly. I will list out couple of things that help me and could possibly help you take your mind off of this obsession (it&rsquo;s more healthy for your brain this way, at least imho)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Understand the person in charge of this company and ask yourself, if all the info out there of this person is true. Can I trust him with my money, if your answer is yes then leave your money with him and go on with your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think of the money you invested in GME is gone, it is no longer your money. If you open a business, the cost of opening a business is gone and you can&rsquo;t take it back so you either follow or fold (take the L if you can&rsquo;t handle it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any specific subreddit is an echo chamber, everyone love the good old confirmation bias. Because we get bored of shit easily since we&rsquo;re living in a instant gratification, we want excitement every day. Control this and you can 100% 💎🤲 this to infinity when it squeeze. (So don&rsquo;t look for confirmation bias)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Worshipping people, you putting that person in control of your decision. If this is your life saving or the money you care so much then why? The one who runs GME is Ryan Cohen, not reddit mods. So stop worshipping people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last one, as much as we all want this play to be our retirement play because you hate your job. Treat this like it isn&rsquo;t, treat it like an investment and not a lottery ticket. Treat it like the squeeze isn&rsquo;t a play but the company&rsquo;s future is so fking bright that it is a no brainer. We know the gaming industry better than these cartridges calling boomers (who the fk use that word anymore). Soon they will cave and be the late investors, be happy you&rsquo;re early.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The only thing everyone need to do right now is vote if their broker allow them to vote. Live your fking life like nothing going to change. Don&rsquo;t let your impatient fk with your money because it will, especially you&rsquo;re going to invest in the future. People lose money in the market mostly because of either impatient or gambling. I know this isn&rsquo;t a typical DD of the stock, but more of a DD of you as an 🦍💎🤲</p>
<p>TLDR: live your life like nothing going to change and 💎🤲🥜🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌙</p>
<p>Edit: did not expect this to receive this much love! Thought nobody gonna see this since people hate hearing the truth (glad I&rsquo;m not the only one!) Have a great day apes and thanks for the awards! Love you guys, just don&rsquo;t want you guys to lose sleep over shit you didn&rsquo;t have to (at least that&rsquo;s how much I trust in RC)</p>
