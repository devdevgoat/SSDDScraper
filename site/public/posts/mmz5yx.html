<p>This would have been a VERY VERY SNEAKY way for short sellers to cover their asses without us knowing from the stock market.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Thank you to u/the_captain_slog for digging into this!</p>

<p>ORIGINAL POST</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t think of this sooner&hellip;.</p>
<p>u/the_captain_slog any help here? Know anything off the top of your head?</p>
<p>A <strong>convertible bond</strong> is a fixed-income corporate <strong>debt</strong> security that yields interest payments, but can be converted into a predetermined number of common stock or equity shares. The conversion from the <strong>bond</strong> to stock can be done at certain times during the <strong>bond&rsquo;s</strong> life and is usually at the discretion of the bondholder.</p>
<p>Anyone know a thing or two about the corporate bond market? Can we objectively calculate this exposure?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Convertible bonds are corporate bonds that can be exchanged for common stock in the issuing company.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Companies issue convertible bonds to lower the coupon rate on debt and to delay dilution.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A bond&rsquo;s conversion ratio determines how many shares an investor will get for it.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Companies can force conversion of the bonds if the stock price is higher than if the bond were to be redeemed.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I know BlackRock is buying a sh*t lod of corporate bonds because I incorrectly stated they were buying TBonds. Could literally mean a HUGE margin call through BlackRock when they convert those bonds.</p>
<p>Wonder how many of those are convertible?</p>
<p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>EDIT 1: Or BlackRock and other bond holders could be converting them into shares and paying the HFs back. But they would be doing it outside of the market.</p>
<p>Q: Wondering if these are the &ldquo;blips&rdquo; we see in AH trading?</p>
