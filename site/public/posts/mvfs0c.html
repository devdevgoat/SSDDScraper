			<p>So yesterday I posted about <strong>FINRA ADF</strong> showing up as the primary exchange for GME trades over the past 6 trading days (and likely much longer). The thing is, FINRA ADF is not currently in operation&hellip;</p>

<p>u/koreanjc had a great post about this a little over a week ago <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mpebkz/sells_through_the_major_exchanges_buys_through/">FADF - A Dark Pool</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mpebkz/sells_through_the_major_exchanges_buys_through/">(wb)</a></p>
<p>While looking into this, I realized that the GME Bloomberg Terminal data is missing between 31.4% and 38.9% of GME daily trading volume from 4/13 - 4/20.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s <strong>19,411,389 missing bananas</strong> over just 6 trading days. Only 70 million GME-issued bananas are supposed to exist&hellip;</p>
<p>If you add up the <strong>total missing volume</strong> + <strong>ADF volume</strong>, you will see that <strong>over 69%</strong> of GME bananas are being reported as trading off exchange (FINRA ADF, which is reportedly not in operation - again see my post from yesterday), or completely missing (a deeper, darker pool that even Bloomberg can&rsquo;t see?).</p>
<p><strong>40,126,778 GME bananas</strong> were traded over 6 days, and even Bloomberg, which costs $24,000/year, has no idea where they are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a finance guy, or a stock guy - I&rsquo;m an ape. I can&rsquo;t really do math, but luckily Excel does the math for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t play options, but if I had call options for 4/16 or 4/23, which are each worth thousands and thousands of dollars, I would certainly want to know what unknown entity is keeping the price of GME at this $160 threshold by hiding <strong>40,126,778 bananas</strong> from making their way to the exchanges.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong> - each day, over <strong>69%</strong> of GME bananas are either missing, or being routed through &ldquo;<strong>FINRA ADF</strong>&rdquo;, which is not currently operating. Someone is hiding your GME bananas to artificially manipulate the GME stock price from mooning. The rocket is fueled for take-off. Can anyone find out what is going on with the missing bananas?</p>

<p>Thanks again to u/Ravada for the daily Bloomberg Terminal drops. All Bloomberg images were taken from his posts.</p>
<p><strong>Bloomberg Data</strong> (just look at the middle of the screen for FINRA ADF and Total Volume):</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1</strong>: Daily GME Volume</p>
<p><img src="../img/xmdt1gno6ju61.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: Edited the Excel sheet to reflect the Nasdaq daily volume (I had used a different source, which had slightly different Total Volume data).</p>
<p>The total missing bananas <strong>increased</strong> from 19,285,389 to <strong>19,411,389</strong>. Also edited the missing banana data for each Bloomberg terminal to reflect Nasdaq. Thanks u/2008UniGrad</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: Added Bloomberg Terminal from 4/21 (below) and added updated Excel sheet to reflect 4/21 data (also below). Updated total missing bananas to reflect 4/21 data.</p>
<p><strong>Total missing bananas</strong> for last 7 trading days = <strong>20,798,855 bananas</strong></p>
<p><strong>Total missing bananas</strong> + <strong>ADF</strong> for last 7 trading days = <strong>42,644,089 bananas</strong></p>
