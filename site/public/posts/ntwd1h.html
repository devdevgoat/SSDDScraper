What’s up
FTSE Russell’s website has been crashing for the past 5 hours but I was finally able to get it to load. Today, FTSE Russell announced preliminary changes to some of their indexes.
Why is this important? Well previously, GameStop was in the Russell 2000, 2500, and Microcap indexes. You can see how companies are organized into these indexes here (wb) page 21." />

<p>What’s up</p>
<p>FTSE Russell’s website has been crashing for the past 5 hours but I was finally able to get it to load. Today, FTSE Russell announced preliminary changes to some of their indexes.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Well previously, <strong>GameStop was in the Russell 2000, 2500, and Microcap indexes</strong>. You can see how companies are organized into these indexes <a href="https://research.ftserussell.com/products/downloads/Russell-US-indexes.pdf?_ga=2.52998315.2077289559.1622740584-1724202943.1618684881">here</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210607020025/https://research.ftserussell.com/products/downloads/Russell-US-indexes.pdf?_ga=2.52998315.2077289559.1622740584-1724202943.1618684881">(wb)</a> page 21.</p>
<p>GameStop was in these indexes because they are market cap weighted, and as of the last reconstitution <strong>in 2020, GameStop’s market cap was a measly ~$200M dollars.</strong> It was scraping the bottom of the barrel for these indexes, even the microcap one. You can see the ranges for these indexes <a href="https://www.ftserussell.com/research-insights/russell-reconstitution/market-capitalization-ranges">here</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210321100144/https://www.ftserussell.com/research-insights/russell-reconstitution/market-capitalization-ranges">(wb)</a>.</p>
<p>Now this is a big deal because as you can see from the median market caps for the mentioned indexes, <strong>GameStop was on the bottom half of each one. But the date of record for adjusting stocks for 2021 was May 7th, and GameStop’s market cap was a <em>whopping</em> $12.5B.</strong></p>
<p>That means <strong>it should be removed from those three indexes</strong>, and <strong>added to the Russell 1000, 500, and Midcap.</strong> Now typically this isn’t a great thing for price action, <a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion">this article</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210318231436/https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion">(wb)</a> discusses how going from the top of the 2000 to bottom of the 1000 causes selling pressure due to adjustments in weight from one of the heaviest weightings to one of the lightest weightings.</p>
<p>However, our pal GameStop has been putting in work recently. Using the medians from the link further up, you can see that <strong>GameStop is going from below the median (bottom 50%) in the old indexes, to above the median (top 50%) in the new indexes</strong> (other than in the Russell 500). <strong>This means that it will gain weight</strong> and <strong>passive fund managers will have to buy oodles of our favorite stock to accurately match the new Russell indexes.</strong></p>
<p>The Russell 1000 is a big deal as far as index funds go, much harder to short a whole index of Wall Street favorites compared to the 2000. <strong>Apple, for instance, is one of the top holdings in the Russell 1000.</strong> There is also the question of what happens to previously shorted ETFs containing GameStop.</p>
<p>Now, this is just speculation, albeit heavily supported speculation. <strong>FTSE Russell hasn’t released the official index changes for the 1000, 500, and Midcap just yet.</strong> They should announce the changes in one of the updates on the 11th, 18th, or 25th. <strong>But they did announce changes for the microcap today, and <a href="https://www.ftserussell.com/files/support-document/russell-microcap-deletions-2021">GameStop is being removed</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210605030126/https://www.ftserussell.com/files/support-document/russell-microcap-deletions-2021">(wb)</a>, thus confirming the theory.</strong></p>
<p>Shoutout /u/WisePhantom for the links</p>
<p>TLDR: GameStop is most likely getting added to the Russell 1000, 500, and Midcap, at a greater weight than it was when it was in the Russell 2000, 2500, and microcap. This is very bullish if true and should result in buying pressure due to passive funds rebalancing ETFs that track the Russell 1000 and others. The reconstitution should be finalized by the 25th.</p>
