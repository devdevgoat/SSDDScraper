			<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last few months reading all the DDs, ingesting all the information, trusting but VERIFYING everything I read.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been here since late last year and I&rsquo;ve been following along extremely closely.</p>
<p>The only way the hedgies and Citadel can STOP the short squeeze is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can&rsquo;t.
=============</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to the unfortunate conclusion that this is the only option. They simply cannot.</p>
<h1 id="you-will-be-out-of-a-job-soon-protect-yourself-claim-your-millions-of-dollars-now">You will be out of a job soon. Protect yourself. Claim your millions of dollars NOW.</h1>
<p>Now that the interns INSTA CLICKED on this post, let me inform you about how you can earn TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS overnight:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower/submit-a-tip">https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower/submit-a-tip</a></p>
<h1 id="the-sec-just-awarded-25000000-each-to-two-individuals-who-blew-the-whistle">The SEC just awarded <strong>$25,000,000</strong> EACH to TWO individuals who blew the whistle.</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower/pressreleases">https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower/pressreleases</a></p>
<h1 id="the-sec-has-now-awarded-approximately-812-million-to-151-individuals-since-issuing-its-first-award-in-2012">The SEC has now awarded approximately $812 million to 151 individuals since issuing its first award in 2012.</h1>
<h1 id="thats-over-5000000-on-average">That&rsquo;s over $5,000,000 on AVERAGE.</h1>
<p>The best part is that the SEC will PROTECT your identity. You can keep the money Citadel and other hedgies paid you to not whisteblow, AND pocket the tens of millions you&rsquo;ll get from blowing the whistle on the biggest financial fraud that has ever occurred. Do you not want to be a part of history? You will be FEATURED in the movie.</p>
