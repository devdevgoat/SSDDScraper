As they like to say in the business: No news is good news. Today I bring you not a single ounce of news regarding these deep in the money calls. Not even so much as a peep out of the HF&rsquo;s buying these calls.
This officially rules out the idea that yesterday was just some crazy coincidence. The time of covering FTD&rsquo;s with Deep ITM calls has come to an end." />

<p>This officially rules out the idea that yesterday was just some crazy coincidence. The time of covering FTD&rsquo;s with Deep ITM calls has come to an end.
