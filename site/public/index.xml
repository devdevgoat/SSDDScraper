      <description>TL;DR- The DTC has been taken over by big money. They transitioned from a manual to a computerized ledger system in the 80s, and it played a significant role in the 1987 market crash. In 2003, several issuers with the DTC wanted to remove their securities from the DTC&amp;rsquo;s deposit account because the DTC&amp;rsquo;s participants were naked short selling their securities. Turns out, they were right. The DTC and it&amp;rsquo;s participants have created a market-sized naked short selling scheme.</description>

      <description>Labeling this DD because, aside from having to do with an offer to be paid to post DD, I actually performed due diligence on the offer (wb).
If you think those alarm posts yesterday about top posters here/YouTubers getting paid to distract apes during the MOASS was FUD, I&amp;rsquo;m here with proof it&amp;rsquo;s totally fucking true. (Details edited out for privacy. More on why below&amp;hellip;) I have now sent unedited proof of the company to mods just for public integrity so you all know I&amp;rsquo;m not making this up.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! It&amp;rsquo;s Warden. I&amp;rsquo;m taking a brief moment to write a chart analysis post because I feel that we are nearing a critical junction point. The volume today has been extremely low, currently sitting at around 1.7 million, and I feel that a lot of people are sensing that something big is coming. I&amp;rsquo;ve emptied the rest of my bank account into the dip today to buy more tickets to the moon.</description>

EDIT May 18, 2021: I have been unbanned; thanks for all the folks who reached out and thanks to the mods!
We&amp;rsquo;ve made it through an exciting weekend of suspense only to end up with yet another day of sideways trading. I&amp;rsquo;d like to examine why I think we have not yet launched based on the bits and pieces that we know.</description>

      <description>First of all, I‚Äôd like to start off by stating this post is completely nonpartisan. GME is not a political debate, it‚Äôs a class war.
Okay, let me ask you guys this ‚Äî how many of you knew that when the pandemic began, the FED pumped $3 trillion dollars into the markets? I watch the news in the background all day, every day, and I didn‚Äôt know at the time when the injections were happening.</description>

      <description>April 9 update: This piece has been heavily edited from its original presentation. I&amp;rsquo;ve had plenty of shit talk about this post. I get it. Some of y&amp;rsquo;all think I&amp;rsquo;m fucking r*tarded for even posting this. But NOT ALL APES HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE JANUARY. I&amp;rsquo;m just trying to help in my limited capacity.

 Brokers preparation - i think everyone should take the time to understand the nuances and rules that the broker applies on trading. Some brokers may have some sneaky fine prints. So you should make sure that nothing can get in the way of you and your tendies.</description>

TL;DR: Hedgies are close to meeting their doom (wb). DOOOM.
Actual TL;DR: June 1st has kicked off with the DTC, ICC, OCC auction and wind-down plans officially being in place.</description>

      <description>Edit: I made a new post describing how I trained the binary classifier (AI) used in this post (wb).
This could be it. This could be the whole scam.
TLDR: HODL. Simple as that. HODL and the shorts have no way to escape. They just writhe around in desperation as FTDs escalate, their options expire and New DTCC rulings approach. To support this belief I:
 Built an AI to detect Deep ITM calls used to create naked shares.</description>

      <description>Updated version - https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nletnn/gme_the_mother_of_all_short_squeezes_moass_thesis/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share
Intro: This post will give a relatively simplistic breakdown of the current situation and landscape of GameStop Stock, or GME (its name on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE), and to summarize the theory that it will soon reach astronomical levels during a market event known as a Short Squeeze. For specifically, this theory is the MOASS (Mother of All Short Squeezes) Thesis.
The core intention of the post is to summarize the MOASS Thesis for investors who are not fully up to speed on it, as well as those who are newer to the stock market in general, and are interested in investing.</description>

Introduction (DD starts below) Apes, did you know that there are usually about 80 confirmed cases of deadly shark attacks per year. You know what nobody ever talks about though? The fact that sharks have TWO, count it TWO, FUCKING PENSIS. I am not making that up. Imagine what I could do with two penises. I&amp;rsquo;d have twice the total dick length.</description>

      <description>TL;DR - I have prepared a case which strongly indicates that Citadel Securities, along with it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;affiliates&amp;rdquo; are committing securities fraud. On March 26th 2021, FINRA released a new citation against Citadel Securities for nearly 2 years worth of securities violations. The only reason Citadel HASN&amp;rsquo;T been busted for fraud is because they hide behind the veil of &amp;lsquo;unintentional&amp;rsquo; behavior. However, this post illustrates how Citadel&amp;rsquo;s actions flag ALL 3 corners of the fraud triangle- pressure, motivation, and opportunity.</description>

      <description>Black rock on CNBC ringing the alarm- too much liquidity in the market. ‚ÄúFEELS FROTHY.‚Äù
Link below, just watched live.CNBC usually uploads these vids to YouTube later.
Edit: From google- ‚ÄúToo much liquidity risks the creation of asset bubbles, like in housing before the financial crisis and farm land afterwards, and distorts financial markets. Throughout the world, ongoing central bank liquidity has bolstered financial assets rather than goods and services that produce growth in the real economy.</description>

      <description>I have been taking some looks at the Level 2 information and it seems that when &amp;ldquo;they&amp;rdquo; want to drop the price, &amp;ldquo;they&amp;rdquo; use smaller lots of bids and asks - today was lots of 11 - 11 shares were being traded back and forth the entire time we saw a drop in the price down by $10. Other apes have noticed this before. See image 1.
I then noticed they stopped trading in these lots, see image 2 below.</description>

      <description>üöÄ Time to expose the shell game. The Shell Game
FTDs are not ‚Äúreset‚Äù. FTDs on ETFs help show the short positions on the underlying securities. Edit: Each Shell Game post is intended to be read sequentially. You&amp;rsquo;ve been misinformed on FTDs. You&amp;rsquo;ll feel great after you go through this journey with me.
 Shell Game II (wb) Shell Game III (wb)  Many talented DD writers have theorized that FTDs are being reset using deep ITM call options and although it appears to be a credible theory that no doubt applies to many stocks, the singular attention it receives may have clouded our vision.</description>

      <description>HOLY MOLY! GME has highest close since 1/29! If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen yesterday&amp;rsquo;s POST (wb), I recommend taking a look before getting into today&amp;rsquo;s action, because BIG THINGS ARE HAPPENING! Congrats to the üíéüñêü¶ç that like movies, as without you, GME wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be on the brink of launch. Prepare yourself, it&amp;rsquo;s time for the tea. This is not financial advice, my üß† is smooth.

Up until 5/27, GME price movements were strongly correlated to AMC, making the year to date R^(2) value between the two 76%.</description>

&amp;quot; The recent financial crisis centered on the sale and repurchase (‚Äúrepo‚Äù) market, a very large short-term collateralized debt market. Repo transactions often involve overcollateralization. The extent of overcollateralization is known as a ‚Äúhaircut.‚Äù Why do haircuts exist?

Or when we lost the indomitable Jamie Foxx in Stealth? Well, the lower you go the higher the probability there is for fatal error. GME volume has been suppressed to a point where any slight mistake by Citadel or added buy pressure will make price go BOOM.</description>

      <description>^(Sit the fuck down before you read this.)
MY THEORY: u/Leenixus was almost certainly correct in Thinking that &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rdquo; got margin called today (wb).
In After Hours 1M shares seemed to &amp;ldquo;disappear&amp;rdquo; from EOD Volume before &amp;ldquo;reappearing&amp;rdquo; in the EOD Volume later before AH close. I BELIEVE this is because Citadel got margin called @ 1127 today and therefor those 1M shares traded had to be re-routed or re-done or what have you.</description>

      <description>Update =========  Edit: Ah here we are after cinco de buyo. No big price move was made. That&amp;rsquo;s some good shit if you ask me. The prediction was that we&amp;rsquo;d see a price surge again if they delayed FTDs once more. The fact that it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen today - no Deep ITM CALLs or PUTs occurred today - is reason to believe this is almost over. If Net Capital theory is correct, there&amp;rsquo;s two possibilities here:</description>

      <description>TL;DR: GameStop is allowed to pay dividends as soon as it deposits the funds for their note buyback - which it can do at any point after the filing of the redemption notice and before the redemption date. If they have already deposited the funds, they can declare a dividend.

      <description>The final picture is starting to come together. The ties of the former CFTC (who now works for citadel) &amp;amp; SEC chairmen to the industry appear to be pointing to fraudulent activity in efforts to prolong the necessity of SOFR being implemented. SOFR the last time it was attempted to transitioned into (in 2019) almost IMPLODED the market due to many realizing that banks and others could not handle a higher interest rate (based off the DAILY TRESURY YIELD RATE (wb)) versus the fabricated one that banks provide.</description>

Addendum‚Äî these lawsuits are mentioned in an upcoming merger- lawsuits related to the debacle fall out from GME in January - the reason I think it‚Äôs a positive thing is the merging brokerage must disclose and they state an increase of awareness of market manipulation and this makes them more liable and also more apt to regard Sec laws.</description>

      <description>Hey guys pdwp90 here, founder of Quiver Quantitative (wb) for those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know me by Reddit tag.
This report is primarily comprised of &amp;ldquo;alternative data&amp;rdquo; which can be loosely thought of as data that comes from outside of traditional sources like earnings reports. The reason this type of data gets me so jacked is because it&amp;rsquo;s data that retail investors (you guys) often have an edge over Wall Street in interpreting.</description>

      <description>Recently there has been a screenshot of a NYSE SRO filing being circulated purporting to show that NYSE is &amp;ldquo;suspending a ton of dark pool groups.&amp;rdquo; Or that NYSE is appealing an SEC ruling or something like that.
So to start, NYSE has nothing to do with dark pools. NYSE is a lit exchange regulated under the Exchange Act, while dark pools are &amp;ldquo;Alternative Trading Systems&amp;rdquo; regulated completely differently (a combination of the SEC and FINRA).</description>

      <description>TL;DR:

      <description>Apes, lend me your ears.
I am pumped that GME took a fat dive from $268.80 down to below $235.00 as of this post. Why? Because it means we&amp;rsquo;ve figured out the modus operandi of the shorts, and HFs are fuk.
TL;DR HODL, because GME is going to the moon. üöÄ

As many of you know, there are multiple reports coming in from various ex-Robinhood apes showing at which prices their shares had to be bought and found in order to finish their transfer to other brokers.</description>

      <description>(clears throat) &amp;ldquo;ehem !&amp;quot;
First of all: Many thanks for all the great feedback you freaking apes gave me on my initial DD (wb) on r/GME. As some time (around 1 month) has passed and we have some new apes and apettes on board and some new information around my initial assumptions has been updated and revealed, I have decided to work on an updated version of my initial DD. So let&amp;rsquo;s start right away, main changes are as follows:</description>

I emphasize &amp;ldquo;might&amp;rdquo;. See below and judge for yourself.
TL;DR:
 On Monday, May 17th, OCC posted an increase to their Clearing Fund of $588,378,155 (wb). This information was found by u/aSphericalCow. In case it isn&amp;rsquo;t clear, OCC is saying that all members must contribute proportionally to add $588m to the common Clearing Fund by Wednesday, May 19 (tomorrow).</description>

I saw some people saying that this rules had changes. But anyone could confirm that if these changes can change the rule of 60 days. So I decided to send an email to the people who propose the law changes.</description>

MAY 7th Edit: They have postponed the ruling until June 21st, please see my followup post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n6zgng/nsc002_delayed_for_longer_period_of_comment_and/
I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen as much talk about this, yet it is the biggest news to come and IT IS the endgame catalyst.
NSCC-801 Passed with no objections yesterday. For this rule to enter effect it needs to piggyback on NSCC-002, which if no objections are made again, will be passed this Friday.</description>

      <description>Hi all, Blanderson here, back this time with all the DD you wanted in a story you didn&amp;rsquo;t ask for.
Here are 100+ DDs that have shaped the GME saga.
This is the story of you, Apes, and the DD writers who have held us together and made us proud. As always, I hope you will enjoy.
I polled the Daily Chat about the name of this post and wanted to shout out some of the top alternatives.</description>

      <description>Some people are getting a little confused. These &amp;ldquo;auctions&amp;rdquo; are not for GME stonk or any other stock for that matter. These are for open options contracts in other companies that have yet to expire and will need to be sold to cover short positions. The OCC handles all options transactions while the NSCC handles securities (stocks) transactions.
This rule is set to drop tomorrow (April 6, 2021) on the federal register.</description>

I would just like to firstly say this is just theory, don&amp;rsquo;t listen to anything I say as i&amp;rsquo;m a smooth brain.
So if you didn&amp;rsquo;t see yesterday JP Morgan&amp;rsquo;s net profit soars 5-fold to $14.3 billion (wb). I find this to be a little unlikely to be honest. We are on the the biggest bull run this market has ever seen, and the money printers keep on running.</description>

      <description>Pre-DD Message: Hello you beautiful apes! Before I get into this DD I just wanted to say that I am so proud of everyone for holding against these wall street crooks. We&amp;rsquo;re finally starting to see some change happen and more and more people are starting to catch on to how fucked of a position the hedgies are really in right now, and it genuinely makes me happy that we&amp;rsquo;ve come from just some stupid retail investors looking for a quick buck to an educated mastermind of apes who scour the sub for DD and knowledge.</description>

Apes, our primate community has gone through a lot in the last 4 months. We‚Äôve been called names, lied to, and manipulated through the same PsyOps techniques typically used on extremist groups.

      <description>So, this post is in response to u/HomeDepotHank69 ‚Äòs request for DD into correlation between stock price movements.
TL/DR:
 Two different scientific methods showing that there is similarity and correlation between certain meme stocks and that this increased since Jan. A machine learning method asked to put stonk data into clusters based on their patterns over the last half year put the meme stonks GME, AMC, KOSS, and others together regardless of which bit of price data you choose to look at.</description>

      <description>Hello apes/retards,
I&amp;rsquo;d like to provide an update to my previous post (wb) which outlines the possibility that BlackRock is in the process of deleting Shitadel out of existence. As of this morning, FINRA has reported no major material changes to its list of major institutional shareholders. However, it maintains the position of BlackRock Fund Advisors at &amp;amp; around 14 million shares.
For the past few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been periodically reviewing the SEC&amp;rsquo;s page on BlackRock&amp;rsquo;s subsidiary firm (wb) in the hopes that a 13G or 13F would pop up indicating of the change in ownership.</description>

Hi all,
There were a lot of apes in the daily discussion thread wondering why the DD by /u/leavemeanon (wb) was gone. Turns out they&amp;rsquo;ve deleted their account for some reason, along with their posts. I did a bit of digging and managed to recover their posts (shoutout to https://camas.github.io/reddit-search (wb)), which I&amp;rsquo;ll be shamelessly reposting as there seems to be some demand:</description>

      <description>Important - See edit 2 at bottom of my write up.
A lot of calls have been added this week on top of what was already the most stacked options week for GME by far. There are no other weeks on the board that are even close to this week. The closest, in July is barely half by volume.
I&amp;rsquo;ll give the quick rundown on calls for the smooth brained and new apes to make sure you understand.</description>

has anyone seen the new UPDATED form posted by the DTCC?
FINAL EDIT!!!!: I think we might be wrong on this one. I‚Äôm sorry to kill the hype but I am thinking that this has less to do with GME. I‚Äôm not 100% sure tho, I would really like to hear from some of the credentialed big brains like u/atobitt and u/rensole. Again I am an ape just like you guys just wanted to get exposure on something that I saw as possibly huge.</description>

      <description>Hello apes/retards. I&amp;rsquo;d like to propose a theory in regards to some of the data that&amp;rsquo;s been floating around over the past few days.
So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen data published by FINRA (wb) which describes total equity ownership ~192%. Many people have insinuated that this % is not accurate due to duplicates of the same entity. However, you can verify that some these entities are not the same, and represent transactions from parent&amp;gt;child or entirely separate positions held by affiliates.</description>

      <description>Good Evening Apes,
Hope all of you are getting settled in nicely here in our new sanctuary. I remind you that you all turn this place from house into a home. Let&amp;rsquo;s get right into it.
Many of you may know me from my previous posts depicting the Deep ITM calls being bought out of the PHLX exchange. Interestingly enough, for the first time since this whole thing started, no large trades of Deep ITM calls were made.</description>

      <description>Hello Apes,
Cheers to all the hedge funds forcing my brain into growing a few wrinkles! I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be here today without you! Y&amp;rsquo;all ready for that dank confirmation bias? Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to puff puff pass this on to any relevant subreddits.
‚Äã
We all &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; there is some major fudgery going on. One of the areas I personally understood the least was Dark Pools or OTC trading. I am not going to pretend I have a masters in economics or hell that I even finished college, but I can assure you I have a black belt in google and know how to operate a spreadsheet.</description>

      <description>See the edits at the end if you want to follow a trail of DDs that leads us here.
This is just a theory. But we know that Citadel has been hiding FTDs in some kind of married put shenanigans, so maybe they have a way to use these shell companies to hide an even greater short position than we can even tell from their activity alone.
Look how Melvin hid their positions for two months by asking for a secret filing even when they knew they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get one.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I am an ape who just learned how to form complete sentences. Please provide any counter evidence to the following theory.
There&amp;rsquo;s a lot out there that the 49% loss on Melvin seems sus in regards to timing and the seemingly &amp;ldquo;too good news&amp;rdquo; especially with the way things have been going. Several OPs suggest that this could be a distraction or a setup for a fake squeeze soon. Both are entirely plausible and I am currently attempting to scour additional records to see if something was swept under the rug and not picked up by MSM.</description>

Since I&amp;rsquo;ve become more active on reddit either making posts, commenting more or responding to DMs I&amp;rsquo;ve started getting threatening messages and &amp;ldquo;insulting&amp;rdquo; comments, these do not bother me and the tone of my posts will now include a lot more sarcasm and mocking in response, please enjoy.

      <description>The purpose of this DD is to look at the outcome if there are many more votes cast at the shareholder meeting than GME shares that are issued and outstanding. I have a background in corporate and securities law, but this is not legal advice (for GME or for apes). Just a recording of one random apes research on a topic of this ape‚Äôs own interest.
The assumption for this DD is that there will be more votes cast or otherwise represented at the shareholder meeting than GME shares that are issued and outstanding.</description>

And I thought, &amp;ldquo;hmm, how do I explain to this ape that of course they know. How? For instance, a ton of them work on Wall Street. Oh! I know. I&amp;rsquo;ll search to see if anyone from the SEC works at Citadel.</description>

Enjoy this beautiful calm before ignition; sleeping soundly tonight, knowing Kenny G isn&amp;rsquo;t.
 Last week I published a report on why Long Whales are orchestrating this channel $175-198 around Max Pain in options market and how it is designed to bleed the Hedge Funds of the funds they have left: Our Whale is Suppressing Volatility to Bleed HFs &amp;ndash; Max Pain Explained (wb)</description>

      <description>TL:DR; after doing two polls and comparing to another user&amp;rsquo;s results, I estimate superstonk users own between 27 million and 35 million shares of GME.
Edit: A very large point of misunderstanding is that the average shares are too high. In statistics, averages are easily skewed by outliers. For example, you have two groups: 3,3,3,2,4,2,4,3 and another 0,0,1,2,10,2,3,4. The average of both is 3. People have said it&amp;rsquo;s impossible for the average person to own $25-30k worth of shares.</description>

      <description>Hi All,
Now that the we are just 7 days away from the shareholder&amp;rsquo;s meeting scheduled for 6/9 I wanted to share some thoughts on what we can possibly expect from the meeting itself.
Gamestop confirmed the meeting for 6/9 at 11am EST and will conclude at 11:15 EST. Dont expect any big announcements during the meeting especially since its only 15 minutes. What usually happens in these meetings is the company will announce the PRELIMINARY results to the proxy vote.</description>

There are several areas where the MOASS could be hindered. Saying the MOASS will be one straight line up is FUD because people will paperhand the moment it goes down. However, these things may or may not happen, so if you day trade, there is a very large chance you get left behind.</description>

None of those really go the whole way. Reverse split is out of the question as the stock is not liquid enough, and there is legal questions surrounding the crypto dividend.</description>

      <description>This post probably will get down vote to oblivion but fk it, I can&amp;rsquo;t be the only one feel like this.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been with GME since October last year and seeing how the og of this play versus now is kind of scary to say the least.
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t as early as DFV or Cohen but I got in because I make bet based on people and after literally watching every RC&amp;rsquo;s interview and reading every article I went all in.</description>

      <description>not financial advice
For people saying that there was a reverse split and that is not a good exemple. Can you provide your source stating this happening in august 2020? The only reverse split I see was in 2018 and thus is irrelevant. The price which shoot from $125 to $25&#39;000 is still a &amp;ldquo;true price&amp;rdquo;
I saw this post saying the fact:

      <description>Preface ==========  I&amp;rsquo;m not a financial advisor. .
Speculative post? OR REAL SHIT? I&amp;rsquo;m pretty hyped about April 16th being a doomsday clock for the hedgies, since that&amp;rsquo;s the time they started working the night shift. &amp;ldquo;Give it up for day 15!&amp;rdquo; as Mr. Krabs would say.
Do you like dates? I like dates. I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to take you on one. Just ask. üòâ
I would like apes to pick at this, because I feel like we&amp;rsquo;re really close to finding the secret sauce to the price movements and predicting the next surge (maybe even MOASS ignition).</description>

      <description>What is a bust out?
In a bust-out scheme, the identity and credit line of a business are used to obtain loans and goods with no intention of repayment. In some instances, businesses are created for this sole purpose; in others, legitimate businesses are acquired and used for the fraud.

      <description>After this week and seeing the massive presence of members of the sub, I‚Äôve been keeping track of how many users are online. The peak of this was 197,000 but we‚Äôve been averaging about 150,000 for about two days straight. Today, the number has slowly declined to about 80,000 about 15 minutes ago. All of a sudden it dropped to 24,000 at 11:20PM. It‚Äôs safe to say that most likely 100,000 accounts here are either bots or old accounts used by shills to maintain an online presence.</description>

Expect fuckery. This is a CRAZY week on the options side. The hedgies absolutely cannot lose control of the price this week, they will use every trick and cheat that exists this week.
I don‚Äôt think this is a week where anyone is worried about max pain. This is a week where hedgies just need the price as low as they can get it to avoid those call options going ITM.</description>

      <description>TL;DR - Hedge funds are manipulating penny stocks by exploiting the OTC market and using a pump and dump strategy to raise funds in their war against us.
 So I have strong evidence to suggest that hedgies are pumping &amp;amp; dumping penny stocks to keep a constant inflow of cash to fight their war against us.
I came about this from skimming through the FINRA OTC data.
At first, I started to look at December data, because I wanted to see if hedge funds were trading penny stocks on inside information, by trading OTC the volume and price isn&amp;rsquo;t affected on the charts and they can essentially trade behind the scenes.</description>

I just wanted to do another compilation this weekend. Re-iterating some old DD I have written as it starts to become applicable to the current situation.

      <description>APES!
The price you see on your broker is the average price between the bid and the ask. The bid is set by the buyers and the ask is set by the sellers. The market makers (Shitadel and others) make their money on the difference. The more liquid a security (which GME isn&amp;rsquo;t at all, hence the extremely low volume and blatant manipulation) the tighter the spread between the Bid and the Ask.</description>

      <description>So, we all knew today was going to be a battle for the $180 point because of the options expiry on this date. Lo and behold, right before we got to the $180 marker at 1:30, we got pushed down pretty intensely.
Now, we had seen a few weeks back a bunch of negative trades at settlement in after hours at 4:15, and then suddenly that stopped. But when the trade volume was exceptionally low, we kept seeing trades disappearing from minute to minute.</description>

      <description>Dear Apes
I am watching a documentary on Amazon Prime called &amp;ldquo;The Inside Job&amp;rdquo;. I have not finished watching it, I just stopped it to run over to my laptop and check something.
In that documentary, the reason banks were able to do all sorts of wacky bullshit - First selling collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which were all the bad mortgages packaged into a high quality McHappy Meal, then later betting against CDOs - was because of essentially bribing regulatory bodies to give them a high rating.</description>

He says it is never glowing this late. He thought it was strange even before i called him!
I found the hotel using Google Maps cuz i went on a hunt for an ape friendly eye-witness confirmation that could confirm whether this is typical. ‚ÄúThis is STRANGE!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe building never glows this late. It is glowing.‚Äù He was a foreigner. These were his words.</description>

      <description>*******Edit 3: last edit, my post you‚Äôll see I added incorrectly with tomorrow‚Äôs date NOT being T+21, that would be Friday 4/23! My initial post I had the 3rd squeeze date as 3/24 by mistake, therefore my day prediction is 1 day off. 4/23 would be the next FTD squeeze! ****** I AM THINKING 4/23 WE SEE SOME GREEN DILDOS
*****Edit 3.1: haha damn okay, I‚Äôm seeing a lot of 4/26 being the 21st trading day after&amp;hellip;so in my smooth brain I included the day of the run up in the calculation!</description>

      <description>Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ve been typing all day and sipping coffee all night, so strap in for my crayon drawings.
Citadel and Point72 have owned at least 51% (controlling interest) in Melvin Capital since January 24th (through a private placement investment/unregistered offering) following Melvin receiving notice that their broker/dealer had margin called them. Let me explain.

Not that I think anyone should read or trust Reuters (or any source for that matter, even me) but they have been an interesting source to evaluate since January.</description>

      <description>Holy Fuck.
This is probably one of the bigger things I have figured out so far.
I sifted through every Citadel Advisors LLC SEC Filing since the squeeze began (I have the spreadsheets to show it) and figured out some fucked up things (oh and I figured out who Suspecthanna is operating as - and they are doing the same thing as Shitadel).

      <description>&amp;quot; Once that CUSIP changes, the naked shorter has no apparent way to close out the naked short position. No stock under the old CUSIP number exists anymore; it all automatically converts to the new CUSIP. &amp;quot; UPDATE AT BOTTOM: CUSIP CHANGE IS INCONCLUSIVE TO FORCE NAKEDS TO COVER. LOOKS LIKE WE NEED CRYPTO DIVIDEND FOR THIS STEP. EXPLANATION BELOW.

After noticing the Crypto crash last night I got hit with a series of &amp;ldquo;It was just a simple 10 BIllions margin call, happens all the time&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;China had a black out and erased billions of dollars&amp;rdquo; or my favorite &amp;ldquo;This is crypto, just zoom out&amp;rdquo;. So you know what I did? I zoomed out.
There have been 4 other spikes downward in Bitcoin before this one and they&amp;rsquo;ve all been this year after the huge run up that started in Dec 2020.</description>

EDIT: Thank you SO much for response, i am overwhelmed and titjacked from your feedback! Thanks!
In response to some FUDPOSTERS arguing to the point that this is not an official SEC communication. Well duh. The first line in this post is clearly saying whats up: &amp;ldquo;its a speech published on SEC website&amp;rdquo;. The speech partially describes what SEC is up to, like LIBOR-stuff and the coming meme-stock report.</description>

TL;DR: Margin is calling. Below is a list of a bunch of other stocks that SPECIFICALLY CITADEL is shorting into oblivion to make money to pay for their debt. Oh, by the way, it&amp;rsquo;s not working out for them.
Not financial advice. I just like the stock. All of them.
I&amp;rsquo;ll keep this short and sweet, it&amp;rsquo;s just a bunch of Ortex/FINRA data on stocks that Citadel is MASS PRINTING to make their money back.</description>

As they like to say in the business: No news is good news. Today I bring you not a single ounce of news regarding these deep in the money calls. Not even so much as a peep out of the HF&amp;rsquo;s buying these calls.
This officially rules out the idea that yesterday was just some crazy coincidence. The time of covering FTD&amp;rsquo;s with Deep ITM calls has come to an end.</description>

      <description>This post is simply putting few facts together and my own interpretation of what it means in the Squeeze to come. This is not a financial advice, just the opinion of a humble Ape with couple of wrinkles.
Mods, please review and flag as appropriate. Apes, feel free to comment, correct or debate. At the end of the day this is my opinion, not better than any of yours.
In this post, I am going to cover what is happening to the VIX, what is happening with the 10 Year treasury note, its link to inflation, and why all this is the beginning of the end of the GME saga, and I believe the squeeze is getting closer (no dates provided if that is what you are after, sorry).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of comments from people wondering why shills are working for hedge funds, after reading the DD because it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear they&amp;rsquo;re going to be out of a job very soon.
I actually put some thought into the situation after this exchange and I believe it&amp;rsquo;s a common misconception. The majority of shills out there on Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube aren&amp;rsquo;t Citadel interns or hired off of LinkedIn.</description>

      <title>DD into fractional GME shares cost after transferring from Robinhood to another broker </title>

      <description>I think that Robinhood has a big problem on their hands (no surprises there). Maybe I never understood PFOF until now, but here is a breakdown of how they were stealing my money and fudging the receipts when I bought fractional shares with them. I would highly recommend that anyone else who bought fractional shares of GME from Robinhood, and then transferred to another broker, check the reported costs.
On Jan 27, 2021 I opened a Robinhood account and spent $300 on fractional shares of GME right at market close and into after market hours.</description>

      <description>I honestly can&amp;rsquo;t believe the time and dedication I&amp;rsquo;ve put into GME. This DD is a representation of how much I care about my 2 shares.
The summary was going to be my morning report for tomorrow, but I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I&amp;rsquo;m going to write down the process I take when I think about aspects of the stock market. I hope someone finds this useful.

      <description>Greetings everyone,
I like to start off saying: This is not financial advice and everyone is open to punch holes in these numbers.
For smooth brain apes TL;DR is at the bottom.
I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a lot of people say: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t trust my word, do your own DD&amp;rdquo;. So i did.
I looked at the values on shortvolumes.com (wb). And for a lot of consecutive days, the volume short was more than half the total volume of the day.</description>

      <description>I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.
Only edit: some of you have been linking me to posts saying that my prediction was just a day early. At first, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think it could be true but now I think there might be some credence because we closed at .01% today and that has only happened 2 other times (went up big the next day). Nevertheless, lets sit back and watch what happens tomorrow.</description>

      <title>Findings from my analysis of 605 data: Huge short position opened in January. Expanded in February and March. Has not been closed. </title>

      <guid>/posts/nc1h4o.html</guid>
      <description>TA;DR: I looked at the 605 data - Citadel‚Äôs short position is so huge it‚Äôs distorted the order flow. It‚Äôs so massive you can see it merely by looking at where the GME orders are being executed. It also shows they haven‚Äôt closed.
TL;DR: Opening a huge naked short position requires market maker shenanigans. Leaving it unclosed requires further market maker fucketry. Both of these should be reflected in the proportion of GME shares executed at various market centers.</description>

      <description>Citadel owns 1473668 shares of AMD as of February 16th 2021.
AMD posted their earnings results yesterday after close.
EPS 52 vs EPS 44 (estimated). Meaning that they did almost 20% above expectations! Yet, the stock price dropped hard and is still dropping.
Who has 798300 calls and 560100 puts on MVIS? Citadel.
What did MVIS do in the past couple of days? Pumped from 10$ to 31$ and then dumped to 21$ this morning.</description>

      <description>It recently occurred to me that in WSB, it‚Äôs against the rules to post about penny stocks, so not a lot of you follow the price action.
I&amp;rsquo;m a day trader and my trading strategy focuses entirely on penny stocks that are owned by hedge funds known to manipulate the market. Most stocks I invest in are all complete garbage, but I look for pump and dumps, obvious manipulation patterns, and anticipate runners based on near-identical charts of multiple companies.</description>

What‚Äôs up
FTSE Russell‚Äôs website has been crashing for the past 5 hours but I was finally able to get it to load. Today, FTSE Russell announced preliminary changes to some of their indexes.
Why is this important? Well previously, GameStop was in the Russell 2000, 2500, and Microcap indexes. You can see how companies are organized into these indexes here (wb) page 21.</description>

Obligatory Disclaimer: I am not a Financial Advisor, and this is not Financial Advice. Always do your own homework. That being said.. lets get started.
TL,DR: Hedies R FuQ. I used data from FTSE Russell&amp;rsquo;s own Database &amp;lsquo;Mergent Online&amp;rsquo; to calculate the current ownership numbers for GME&amp;hellip; and my TITS ARE JACKED.
I found some very interesting ownership numbers for GME today. I am using Mergent Online as my data source, which is produced by FTSE Russell.</description>

Since I saw u/atobitt referencing Cede and Co in his current DD I wanted to just put this back out into the world as this post never took off in r/GME or r/wallstreetbets (a couple hundred upvotes) like it did in r/stocks (5k+ upvotes + all the awards which is basically all my accounts karma) and I feel like the info could be useful for people who want a bit more background on Atobitts post.</description>

TLDR at the bottom.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been sitting on my FOIA requests for about two months now, not wanting to make a post until I received an actual response. My request for a fee waiver was granted, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to spend any $$$ better suited for more crayons to shove between my gorilla molars, but my request for an expedited process was denied. Apparently the financial risks to hundreds of thousands of Ape wallets doesn&amp;rsquo;t constitute a national emergency, so I had to wait two more months before hearing anything back.</description>

Apes, I would like you to meet Motley Fool Asset Management https://www.mfamfunds.com/index.html (wb), the sister company of the Motley Fool.
This company has several funds and ETFs on their site. So I took a look at the top holdings for each one then did a search on motley fool for their articles to see if they are upholding their mission to help readers obtain financial information and discuss ways to make investment and personal financial decisions (wb) are just a propaganda machine to boost the stock prices of their holdings (spoiler alert: It&amp;rsquo;s the propaganda one)</description>

This is 114 months from 4/14/21 there are so many data points you can&amp;rsquo;t see it&amp;rsquo;s absurd
So a beautiful autist wrote some code and put the data on tableau, it&amp;rsquo;s the harvested FINRA FTD data for all tickers available.

This post is the collective narrative behind the plays on GME by large institutions. This will be a multi-part DD post gathered from excellent insights on this sub. As there have been no open confessions of these activities by the perpetrators (a la Bernie Madoff), or books that have yet been written, this will only exist as a theory with pieces of evidence to support where we can.</description>

      <title>BlackRock and share recall for voting: We aim to vote at 100% of meetings... </title>

      <description>Straight from their website.
We aim to vote at 100% of meetings where our clients have given us authority to vote their shares, and therefore vote at approximately 16,000 shareholder meetings in approximately 85 markets each year. With regards to non-U.S. holdings, generally we estimate that we vote successfully at approximately 90% of meetings. Of the remaining, 8% are not voted due to shareblocking and 2% are not voted due to either the fund‚Äôs leverage, impediments such as ballots received post cut-off date or post meeting date, or other restrictions like in-person attendance or power of attorney being required in order to vote.</description>

      <title>Gary Gensler, 47%, Antitrust, and Yet Another Reason Why Citadel is Likely Irrevocably Fucked </title>

      <description>47%, Gary Gensler, Antitrust, and Citadel Gary Gensler talked about a lot of stuff at the hearing earlier this week. The representatives generally focused on a lot of garbage, and they have justifiably taken a lot of shit from this community for their piss poor understanding of the things they are supposed to oversee. Lost in the gamification discussion was Gary Gensler talking about market concentration and Citadel how 47% of all retail order flow is routed through Citadel.</description>

      <description>APES. It has been a very good week. Don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone try to tell you otherwise. Barely a week ago we were fighting for $180, now we have rock solid support at $245-250. It is all spelled out in black and white (green and red?) on the month-long chart: we are winning this battle.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you but it has been quite a journey to get this far. Lots of twists and turns and emotions.</description>

      <description>Edit: Grammar and thank you for the awards! Credit goes to all the apes who are helping to slide the pieces together and doing legwork. There is so much complexity to all this by fucking design and without the sheer number of people who are working tirelessly daily, none of this may have come to light and retail would keep getting bent over.
Borrowing from u/ForgottenBob, this should help for a summary or TL:DR.</description>

Alright apes, this is gonna be a strange post. So as many of you know, I recently sent out a request for coders/big brain apes for a DD that I plan to make.

      <description>TL;DR
Investment companies are filing for amendments to combine the liability of holdings not registered with the SEC investment companies and they&amp;rsquo;re buying government bonds through Principal Funds and filing those, while changing the language in their contacts regarding using those funds to up their liability insurance and assumedly collateral, or at best stability.
A number of these bonds have a value in the trillions.
Okay here we go
I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the entire weekend pouring through SEC filings, and they tell a slow but compelling story that&amp;rsquo;s been unfolding.</description>

Short version (TL;DR): I have confirmed by combing through the eToro APIs that there are exactly 96,660 GME holders on the eToro platform.</description>

In the US we never saw this ad but in Europe it was all over. How do I know? I live in Europe now.
I showed it to my gf and she said ‚Äúah I know that bear, that‚Äôs from T2‚Äù
I said what do you mean T2 and she said yea it‚Äôs from a movie called T2. So i asked her why she called it that and she said she never saw the movie but that it was advertised as T2 in this ad where he is shaking a martini and turns around.</description>

Welcome to The Chicago Code: Shitadel, a shitty crime drama television series created by Ken Griffin that aired on Reddit on the 18th of May.
Not financial adv&amp;hellip;yada yada bing bong. I am not from the US, so try to sue me for anything. I&amp;rsquo;ll wear a tinfoil hat and defend myself. Just an FYI: I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to &amp;lsquo;shorting&amp;rsquo; when I am talking about a superior put position. Given the past of the stock and the option anomalies, as well as typical SHF behavior, it is highly likely that superior put positions indicate a short position to drive the price down.</description>

      <description>So I just finished watching The Wall Street Conspiracy and I decided I wanted to dig a bit deeper to understand how naked short selling works. I highly suggest you watch the documentary as I found it really helpful to understand how hedge funds attack companies to achieve the Bankruptcy Jackpot.

Greetings, Apes. Today I was contemplating whether to cut my hair into a mohawk or to get a bald fade. Obviously, those are very similar. Today, I decided to listen to Linkin Park&amp;rsquo;s smash hit, &amp;ldquo;WAP,&amp;rdquo; which always gets me going. I was definitely feeling a little high cuz I had just consumed THREE, yes THREE, fig newtons when I got a message from another primate.</description>

Pick the first thing you can think off ‚Äì let‚Äôs say, bananas. Then think of any characteristic of that banana, lets say ‚Äúsize of bananas‚Äù. I can assure you that, if you plot into a graph the size of every banana in the world, you would get a Gauss (normal) Distribution for that characteristic.
‚ÄúŒº‚Äù (mu) is the middle point, which is the most common size for bananas.</description>

      <description>Alright apes and apettes. Like the rest of you, I am jacked to the TITS after seeing the recent Gamestop 14A filing (wb). I wanted to see what the remaining float was and if retail ownership really could be over 100%. So what&amp;rsquo;s the remaining float after insider and institutional ownership?
‚Äã
Outstanding Float
As per the 14A filing, there are 70,771,778 Gamestop shares outstanding. Institutional Ownership (minus Ryan Cohen&amp;rsquo;s LLC) comes out to 32,433,338 .</description>

What I&amp;rsquo;m presenting is 100% based on the publicly available published FINRA OTC data. The way FINRA presents their data makes it really difficult to spot anomalies and trends, so I decided to compile it into an Excel spreadsheet. The trends are clear. The data is revealing.

      <description>Tick tock. Tick tock.
Yesterday, we reviewed volume data on GME for every day since mid-January (wb) in part one (of an undetermined number of posts). In that post, the data showed a trend of declining volume since the first squeeze and made a case for the increasing risk of slippage and volatility.
Given the short hedge funds have made volume drier than the steak my wife&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend&amp;rsquo;s made tonight, it&amp;rsquo;s becoming important to look for other indicators of the trend in this story.</description>

(Re-posting this again. I previously posted it at an ungodly hour for most Apes, so was requested to share again.)
I have seen quite a few posts recently about The Motley Fool&amp;rsquo;s business model, and decided to look a little more under the hood.

Apety apety apes. What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between GME and my wife? GME doesn&amp;rsquo;t fuck the mailman.

Let&amp;rsquo;s get right down to business. I have reason to believe the price action we are seeing is nearly identical to January right before we ran ago 500+.</description>

Before I cover this topic I need to first mention two things number one not financial advice two one of the major plot points I use has been slightly covered but I plan to dive into different correlations between this plot point and how it actually ties to the market.</description>

      <description>EDIT 3: THIS SHOULD BE TAKEN AS GOOD NEWS!!!
The initial concern was that GameStop sold a bunch of bonds that have the option to convert into shares of common stock.
‚Äã
This means an owner of GameStop&amp;rsquo;s bond can convert (under certain circumstances) into shares of GME to cover a large short position, without being traded on the market.

I have been informed by a few people that they do not have a currently have CONVERTIBLE BONDS</description>

      <description>Hello, fellow apes!
Gherkinit here with another look forward at upcoming technical events, market fuckery, and some spectrum colored crayons.
This week I want to go over upcoming technical indicators and take a look at some things I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed happening over this last week, such as, disappearing volume, lying little boys from Bulgaria, and the apparent effects of inflationary naked short selling.
As always later tonight I will post a consolidated Video DD of this on my YouTube (wb) for those of you that don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to read through this.</description>

Preface ==========  Not a financial advisor. I also have no financial experience or qualifications. Thought I&amp;rsquo;d make that clear per a commenter on my last post who wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy with me. ;)
Also apologies if some of this doesn&amp;rsquo;t read right. A bit buzzed typing it up lmao. I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to clarify anything in the comments.
Hello apes. You might remember my previous posts. But just in case, I&amp;rsquo;ll add them here once more because I&amp;rsquo;d like to expand on them a bit further.</description>

      <title>Actual theory about the 49% loss </title>

      <guid>/posts/mo0ods.html</guid>
      <description>It just occurred to me&amp;hellip;
They&amp;rsquo;re not reporting 49% loss on the short position itself.
Because like they say you dont lose til you sell. And if they covered, they&amp;rsquo;d have lost a lot more. The number 49% makes no sense to me as a short position loss the more I think about it. Because it would bankrupt them. They&amp;rsquo;d be -1000% not -49%
This occurred to me battling shills. So thank you shills.</description>

      <description>Edit 1: At the risk of exciting people for no reason, I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t want to set expectations and crash them like how it is happened so many times. Please, instead, see this as evidence that there is something very wrong about GME.
Edit 2: The title should be IMPLIED volatility. Sorry, folks. Was just trying to get this out fast.
Edit 3: Some folks are saying this is IV counteracting theta decay.</description>

What follows is highly likely to be nothing more than evidence of my early onset dementia and it is certainly not any kind of advice, but I felt compelled to share it in the event it is a useful puzzle piece to anyone whose has been wondering about a possible relationship between hedge funds and crypto holdings, the sort that have been circling the rumor mill lately.</description>

      <description>Large whales like BlackRock have the obvious potential to initiate a squeeze, were they to recall their large number of loaned out shares, but one thing most of you are missing is until these regulations are locked in they wont &amp;ndash; regardless of the recall/voting. All of you should read these posts below, they very plainly, and brilliantly, lay out what exactly those regs are doing for our whales (and the markets health/safety in general) in great depth, but to give you a simplified version:</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been here since late last year and I&amp;rsquo;ve been following along extremely closely.
The only way the hedgies and Citadel can STOP the short squeeze is the following:
 They can&amp;rsquo;t. =============  I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the unfortunate conclusion that this is the only option. They simply cannot.

      <description>Hi fellow apes ü¶çü¶çü¶çand welcome to Superstonk!
With these volumes, It looks like everyone took a nap today! Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the historical volumes and any relations we can see with share price changes.
&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;- BOILERPLATE:
I still know nothing, I can&amp;rsquo;t do math good. PLEASE don&amp;rsquo;t listen to me! Obligatory üöÄüöÄüöÄ
TLDR: Today was the lowest volume trading day since Tuesday January 12 (when the price $19.95)! Historically we have seen huge volume trading days (and big price gains) on the Wednesday and guess what tomorrow is?</description>

      <description>First of all, a note behind my thinking regarding sending my findings to the SEC and FINRA: Regarding: https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mihbr1/i_have_contacted_the_sec_regarding_my_findings_of/ (wb) if you missed it
There were many of these comments:
 &amp;lsquo;they&amp;rsquo;re not gonna do anything&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;they&amp;rsquo;re in bed with the hedgies&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;now they&amp;rsquo;re gonna halt trading and screw the squeeze&amp;rsquo;  and while some may be from shills (last one especially), the first two are not an unreasonable sentiment to have at this point.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m a smooth brainer with a lot of time.
So the reason for this little DD is because of a certain find by u/PapaTheSmurf and his post
https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nd39dl/srnysearca202054_need_some_wrinkles_asap/ (wb)
The finding in question is as follows and it clicked in a couple of missing pieces to a theory I have about our secret whale.
https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysearca/2021/34-91901.pdf (wb)
This rule appears to provide an exemption for companies that fall under ‚Äúinvestment companies‚Äù in obtaining shareholder permission before issuing securities that relate to acquisition of stock or assets of another company.</description>

The reason this is very fascinating to observe is because it reveals a much deeper image of their collapsing empire. How does it do that you ask? Well, if you look at the Parent company of Union Bank it turns out it is: MUFG Bank.
