---Black rock on CNBC ringing the alarm- too much liquidity in the market. “FEELS FROTHY.”


Link below, just watched live.CNBC usually uploads these vids to YouTube later. 


Edit: From google- “Too much liquidity risks the creation of asset bubbles, like in housing before the financial crisis and farm land afterwards, and distorts financial markets. Throughout the world, ongoing central bank liquidity has bolstered financial assets rather than goods and services that produce growth in the real economy.”


HE ENDED SAYING “WITH SO MUCH LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET TODAY, THERE IS LITERALLY NO VALUE IN THE MARKET TODAY.” - Rick Rieder, Chief Investment Officer of Blackrock (whom manages $9 trillion of assets worldwide and owns 13.2% of gme). 


Edit: Actual quote: “The flood into high quality assets, because liquidity is so large, there is literally no value in the markets today.”
