Gooooooood morning my space astronauts!


Let's cut straight to the chase.


We're up in the premarket. A bit overextended so don't be surprised by a small market open dip.

My gut feeling says that we're nearing the beginning of something big. This low volume will eventually go away and we'll some more wilder swings later in the week. Perhaps we can get a slow steady climb today.
