---It just occurred to me...


They're not reporting 49% loss on the short position itself.


Because like they say you dont lose til you sell. And if they covered, they'd have lost a lot more. The number 49% makes no sense to me as a short position loss the more I think about it. Because it would bankrupt them. They'd be -1000% not -49%


This occurred to me battling shills. So thank you shills. Once again you fucked yourselves up by not giving up ðŸ˜‚


They're reporting a cash loss.


The cash loss is the interest fees on the short position..........


They lost 49% on the INTEREST FEES ALONE.


That's my theory. Does it make sense?


Edit: anonymous all seeing eye award. Someone sees the Deep Fucking Value of this theory.
