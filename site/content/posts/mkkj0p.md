**Edit 17 4:02PM:**


Ended around 186.13 for the day, small bounce in the last few minutes!


Overall a great day, see you all tomorrow!

**Edit 16 3:46PM:**


Low volume, should finish above 182 for the day. Added a new 182 support.

**Edit 14 2:26PM:**


Quick summary of how to detect a short squeeze 24 hours before the squeeze.


Go to <https://www.tradingview.com/script/nO5Y6yTa-CV-VWAP-GME/> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210228095106/https://www.tradingview.com/script/nO5Y6yTa-CV-VWAP-GME/) and favorite the CV VWAP indicator.


Then in TradingView, turn that indicator on under the favorites list. It's pretty simple to use.

Basically if the silver line goes near or above the dotted red line above, its a positive signal for an incoming short squeeze. Don't pay attention to the indicator during AH or PM. Only during trading hours.


There's a couple false signals and intricacies of how to read the signals properly. I explained it early on in my stream today.


**Edit 13 1:37PM:**


We were quite close to crossing 200 like my friend in the chat had predicted. We touched 195. Close enough!


I'll be back at power hour, mostly just sideways trading on low volume right now.


**Edit 12 1:09PM:**


Nothing crazy happening, we're sagging towards VWAP, volume dying down.

**Edit 11 12:14PM:**


Local double top. Stock will consolidate a bit lower.


![](/img/ug0wdbqiqdr61.png)
**Edit 10 11:38AM:**


Gap fill today.


![](/img/d78739y3kdr61.png)
**Edit 9 11:31AM:**


WE GOIN UP!


![](/img/lpkd3agzidr61.png)
**Edit 8 11:27AM:**


Rough rough prediction for the week. Letting that IV crush.


![](/img/qgvay8dbidr61.png)
**Edit 7 11:21AM:**


Someone shorted 1m worth of Puts at the 200 strike. This is very bullish imo.


![](/img/91cbmrm3hdr61.png)
**Edit 6 11:19AM:**


Mostly bullish in terms of options activity. Lots of long calls getting put in.


![](/img/cxagj1drgdr61.png)
**Edit 5 11:09AM:**


Decently low volume. We're finding a good consolidation zone between 176.5 and 184 channel.

**Edit 4 10:05AM:**


I will be on in 10 minutes, did you all catch the dip?


**Edit 3 9:34AM:**


No one is selling haha. Look at that low volume!


**Edit 2 9:31AM:**


Reminder I have a meeting until 10:15 EDT. Use everything I showed you guys to find a dip! You guys got this!
