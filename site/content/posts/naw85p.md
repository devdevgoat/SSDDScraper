---Hello, fellow apes! ü¶ç
=====================


First of all, this is not financial advice. Do not take anything I say here as the absolute truth. Make your own due diligence and take your own conclusions.


I stopped going into Reddit and watching the ticker a few days ago because my bias was already 100% confirmed, but yesterday I started to receive comments and awards in my old post: [Proxy Voting DD,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxwfyt/proxy_voting_dd_how_the_count_works_and_timeline/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210511231040/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxwfyt/proxy_voting_dd_how_the_count_works_and_timeline/) and it caught my attention.


I think I predicted why GameStop is being so public about the MOASS right now, and I want to show you why.
==========================================================================================================

GameStop voting tabulator for the 2021 Shareholder Meeting is **Computershare** *(*[*Proxy document*](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-126940/#toc122967_28) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210423151827/https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-126940/)*, page 12)*, a company that specializes in multiple things relevant to the stock market (proxy voting, direct purchases of shares, and more). Knowing this, I found two things:


A) How GameStop may have already received their first voting reports
====================================================================


**Georgeson** is a "sub-company" of Computershare, and it seems they function like the Computershare division for proxy voting.


On Georgeson's site, there is an ["Annual Meeting Calculator"](https://www.georgeson.com/us/annual-meeting-calculator) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210511202404/https://www.georgeson.com/us/annual-meeting-calculator) so that companies can see the timeline of relevant events before the shareholder meeting's desired date.


If we put the GameStop meeting date, we can see what are the expected and estimated dates for certain events:

We know GameStop filled their proxy statement with the SEC way earlier than that (4/22, thank you RC!) so the entire timeline of events should be shifted.


Take a look at what is expected on May 24

If my maths are correct, May 24 is around 13 business days after May 5 (SEC filling date) so we can use that to calculate the actual date.


**I estimate that GameStop should have received their first voting reports around 5/11 (yesterday).**


This makes complete sense, they would not address the MOASS if they didn't know the vote count. **We are in the endgame now.**


B) What will happen to retail votes when there is an over-vote?
===============================================================


As you may already know, when the vote count exceeds the total amount of shares, the votes are just "retouched" so that the vote count is less than the total amount of shares.


**This changes nothing for us:** the spark that could ignite the MOASS is not the election in itself, but rather the real vote count. Just the mere fact that they disclose the real vote count will be enough for everyone to see how fucked the shorts are and everyone will jump on the bandwagon.


Even though it doesn't matter for the MOASS, I wanted to know more about how the votes are "retouched", to see how unfair it may be.


I found a document titled ["Over-Voting And The Options"](https://www.computershare.com/ca/en/Documents/CPU_OVER_VOTING_OPTION_en.pdf) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210512185504/https://www.computershare.com/ca/en/Documents/CPU_OVER_VOTING_OPTION_en.pdf), by Computershare that shows us exactly that. There are basically 6 strategies that Computershare provides to "retouch" the votes, **at least in normal scenarios** (this may not apply to GME).


I think the less-harmful option would be Option 3, and I hope is the one that GameStop uses if it's forced to choose one:

That's all I have for today.


BUY, HOLD, VOTE.
