HOLY SHIT!
==========


Dear Apes,


I decided to do some homework today. I know some of this is not new information but I contacted my broker and started asking questions. This was the part I found shocking...(I'm removing the reps name so not to get them in trouble) and that I had no idea that I couldn't call back my shares or even have a vote in the proxies ....


14:58 **TD**: *I can remove your margin for you. That would allow you to have the ability to vote in the proxies.*


14:58 **Anonymous**: I still would like to know the answer about switching over from margin to cash and if that would cause my shares to be recalled, if they are lent out short


14:59 **TD**: *It will*


14:59 **Anonymous**: wait are you saying I wouldn't have been able to vote in the proxies if I stayed on margin?


14:59 **TD**: *And you would then have the ability to vote the proxy.*


14:59 **Anonymous**: Wait wait go back, are you saying that if I stayed on margin, would I not been able to vote in the upcoming proxies?


15:00 **TD**: *If you stayed on margin you would not. Correct.*


15:01 **Anonymous**: interesting. so you are saying all those people who are on margin accounts, they don't actually get to vote in the annual meetings?


15:01 **TD**: They would not have a vote if they were on a margin account.


Breakdown:
==========


**If you are on margin, not only are your shares able to be lent without your consent (Basically, you gave them consent when you signed up for margin) BUT that you can't recall your shares for the Annual meeting, nor will you have the right to vote in the proxies. Also, people have been asking, I have a zero margin balance and extra cash sitting in the account and this was still the conversation.**


​


**I knew about the lending of shares but I didn't realize you can't even vote or recall your shares on margin.** I'm sure most of you all didn't realize that part either. I know some of you are annoyed I hadn't switched but I have a feeling I'm not the only one. I know there was DD that told everyone to switch to cash, but I know I didn't. I doubt that I'm the only Ape who didn't switch over to cash either because I thought I wouldn't be able to trade options. Well guess what, I confirmed with them. You can still buy options on cash only.


From this conversation, if your shares are sold short on your margin account....this would force your broker to actually call back the shares lent short. If everyone was to call or message their brokers this week, and to switch to cash only, if your shares were lent out they would recalled. You would also be allowed to vote in the upcoming Proxy vote.
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================


**At this point, if you are on Margin you don't have any rights as a GameStop shareholder and your shares are definitely being used as ammo against any long shareholder of GME. I had no idea that I couldn't recall my own shares or even not have my vote counted on margin.......OH SHIT!**


​


I switched today. Will you ensure your shares are yours for the upcoming vote? All you have to do is call or message your broker to switch you over like I just did.


​


To anyone saying this isn't DD. I called up and confirmed for Apes how the process works. In an edit I will include every brokers number and directions on how to do it. **If anyone has made the switch from margin to cash before, please help the community out by posting directions on how you did it and which broker!!**


​


====================================================================


**Edit 1:** Some people are saying to not make the switch until the meeting has been announced. Personally, I already did it but you all do whatever you want. **The main thing I want is for Apes to be aware of the power to call back shares lent short by our brokers is only done by switching to a cash account and that you will not have voting rights unless you make that switch.**


**Edit 2:** For those of you annoyed, because you all switched back in Jan, I'm sorry that I didn't do it. I thought it was going to effect my ability to trade options and I have 2 brokerages that I was dealing with/switching over. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only ape who didn't make the switch back then. But we do have an opportunity to spread this message around and get every ape the ability to vote/recall their shares.


**Edit 3:** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2n5wv/most\_of\_you\_are\_helping\_the\_gme\_shorts\_and\_you/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2n5wv/most_of_you_are_helping_the_gme_shorts_and_you/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210220162815/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2n5wv/most_of_you_are_helping_the_gme_shorts_and_you/)


This was linked to me. I never read it until now. It only have like 5k upvotes at the time and I wasn't following WSBs as often after my ban for "Copying and pasting DD" on WSB during the run up.

Well. I just got off the phone with TDA and was told in no uncertain terms that it made no difference whatsoever if you have a margin account or cash account, they **DO LEND OUR SHARES. PERIOD.** The only way you can prevent lending is to request physical certificates held in YOUR NAME, and was told that it can cost anywhere from $200-$700 depending on the company(stock). Then the issue becomes trading (selling) you will have to send them back to them to initiate a trade ( sale). I don’t know how this can be legal, but it was absolutely clear that is what they are doing. 100% clear they are lending shares.


**Edit: if you are with TDA, you need to call to confirm yourself. I’m livid.**

WeBull users remember: it will take approximately 6 business days on a best efforts basis to switch from margin account to cash account. During this time, you will **NOT** be able to trade or make a withdrawal.


***Edit* Add-On***


You can turn off the lending program on WeBull though. Not sure if that helps or not but the more you know.


**How to change from Margin to Cash WeBull:**


1. Go to the Home page
2. Click [Account] Tap
3. Scroll down to find [Change Account Type]
4. Submit your application

On the app = Got to: Your account(middle button at bottom), click More, Account Details (scroll to bottom, “cash” or “margin” shown here), Change Account Type, then click “Exit Now” under “share lending program” and follow the prompts.


Edit: [u/khashi1](https://www.reddit.com/u/khashi1/) [(wb)](https://www.reddit.com/u/khashi1/) steps for Webull, account status is also in this menu to see if you have a cash or margin account.


[You\_Still\_Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/You_Still_Reddit/) [(wb)](https://www.reddit.com/user/You_Still_Reddit/)**💎🙌**


My Webull was also set to cash account so I thought I was good. **Turns out, they have a “share lending program” that you HAVE to opt out of. It automatically enrolls you when you setup the account.**

Correction to IBKR: you don't have to convert to cash account, it should be enough to turn off participation in „Stock Yield Enhancement Program“ - there is a setting for that.

Robinhood app, click the "person " icon on bottom right, then the 3 lines at top right. Choose "investing" at the top. Go all the way to the bottom and click "day trading options". You can downgrade to cash account there. I think that does it. Someone please confirm

ETRADE UPDATE


Just got off the phone with ETRADE support. These are as close to their words as I could recall.


1. If you are on a margin account your shares **"may"** be lent out, but **"typically"** unless you using your margin they do not lend them.
2. Even if your shares are lent out the **owner of record** "me" would still **have/maintain** the voting rights.
3. In order to remove the margin from my account:a. **Must** have all trades settled. aka T+2b. **Must** "call" ETRADE support **800-387-2331** and request to have your margin removedc. The margin removal will take **1 business day** to remove and account will be unable


Hope this helps.

So for Trading212 If you have a ISA account, it's against the UK law to lend out your share But in regards to voting They don't have the option set up yet and they don't have a timeframe as to when they will get it done so essentially if you have Trading212 you cannot vote.
