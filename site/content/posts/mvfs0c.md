---So yesterday I posted about **FINRA ADF** showing up as the primary exchange for GME trades over the past 6 trading days (and likely much longer). The thing is, FINRA ADF is not currently in operation...

u/koreanjc had a great post about this a little over a week ago [FADF - A Dark Pool](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mpebkz/sells_through_the_major_exchanges_buys_through/) [(wb)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mpebkz/sells_through_the_major_exchanges_buys_through/)


While looking into this, I realized that the GME Bloomberg Terminal data is missing between 31.4% and 38.9% of GME daily trading volume from 4/13 - 4/20.


That's **19,411,389 missing bananas** over just 6 trading days. Only 70 million GME-issued bananas are supposed to exist...


If you add up the **total missing volume** + **ADF volume**, you will see that **over 69%** of GME bananas are being reported as trading off exchange (FINRA ADF, which is reportedly not in operation - again see my post from yesterday), or completely missing (a deeper, darker pool that even Bloomberg can't see?).


**40,126,778 GME bananas** were traded over 6 days, and even Bloomberg, which costs $24,000/year, has no idea where they are.


I'm not a finance guy, or a stock guy - I'm an ape. I can't really do math, but luckily Excel does the math for me.


I don't play options, but if I had call options for 4/16 or 4/23, which are each worth thousands and thousands of dollars, I would certainly want to know what unknown entity is keeping the price of GME at this $160 threshold by hiding **40,126,778 bananas** from making their way to the exchanges.


​


**TLDR** - each day, over **69%** of GME bananas are either missing, or being routed through "**FINRA ADF**", which is not currently operating. Someone is hiding your GME bananas to artificially manipulate the GME stock price from mooning. The rocket is fueled for take-off. Can anyone find out what is going on with the missing bananas?

Thanks again to u/Ravada for the daily Bloomberg Terminal drops. All Bloomberg images were taken from his posts.


**Bloomberg Data** (just look at the middle of the screen for FINRA ADF and Total Volume):

**Edit 1**: Daily GME Volume

**Edit 2**: Edited the Excel sheet to reflect the Nasdaq daily volume (I had used a different source, which had slightly different Total Volume data).


The total missing bananas **increased** from 19,285,389 to **19,411,389**. Also edited the missing banana data for each Bloomberg terminal to reflect Nasdaq. Thanks u/2008UniGrad


​


**Edit 3**: Added Bloomberg Terminal from 4/21 (below) and added updated Excel sheet to reflect 4/21 data (also below). Updated total missing bananas to reflect 4/21 data.


**Total missing bananas** for last 7 trading days = **20,798,855 bananas**


**Total missing bananas** + **ADF** for last 7 trading days = **42,644,089 bananas**
