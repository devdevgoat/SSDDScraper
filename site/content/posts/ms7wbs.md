Apes, I would like you to meet Motley Fool Asset Management <https://www.mfamfunds.com/index.html> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210416151127/https://www.mfamfunds.com/index.html), the sister company of the Motley Fool.


This company has several funds and ETFs on their site. So I took a look at the top holdings for each one then did a search on motley fool for their articles to see if they are upholding their mission to [help readers obtain financial information and discuss ways to make investment and personal financial decisions](https://www.fool.com/legal/the-motley-fool-disclaimer/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210126110256/https://www.fool.com/legal/the-motley-fool-disclaimer/) are just a propaganda machine to boost the stock prices of their holdings **(spoiler alert: It's the propaganda one)**


You can find their funds here: <https://www.mfamfunds.com/our-products.html> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210210021150/https://www.mfamfunds.com/our-products.html)


---------- **#1 Holding: Amazon**


**Amazon is their number 1 holding in their FOOLX fund** but can be found at some % on most of them**.** And just take a look at the articles. literally they are banging out 3-4 articles A DAY saying how amazing Amazon is

​


**---------- #2 Holding: Watso Inc.**


This is the **number 1 holding in their TMFGX fund.** I had never heard of this company, but motley fool has over 100 articles about it and once again all singing its praises.


​

**---------- #3 Holding - Apple**


Apple is their **number 1 holding in their motley fool 100 ETF (TMFC)** and they actually **wrote some negative articles** about them... **just kidding!**


​

**---------- GME**


AAAAANNNNDDD now let's get to GME:

As you can see, not so great. They even did some comparisons between amazon, i wonder what they suggested...

**Now some of you may "wait, this seems like blatant market manipulation?" and if this was a just world then answer would be DUH!!!** 


**BUTTTTT, at the bottom of their articles, they disclose that they do have a position in the stock (and even their call option recommendations...), its just in size 5 font after another long disclaimer.** 


**So at least they are nice enough to let you know they are manipulating you if you bother to read the fine print.**


​

**Update:** so i clicked on their disclosure policy <https://www.fool.com/legal/fool-disclosure-policy/> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141254/https://www.fool.com/legal/fool-disclosure-policy/) and found this GEM:

and also this from their disclaimer page <https://www.fool.com/legal/the-motley-fool-disclaimer/> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210126110256/https://www.fool.com/legal/the-motley-fool-disclaimer/)

**So funny that they say that they are not here to give you buy or sell recommendations when they literally say "Recommends Apple. The Motley Fool recommends the following options..."**


So if you had any doubt about the purpose of motley fool, it is just propaganda to prop up their holdings and downplay any other company that could threaten them.
