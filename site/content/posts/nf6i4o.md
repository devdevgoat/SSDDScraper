**Welcome to The Chicago Code: Shitadel, a shitty crime drama television series created by Ken Griffin that aired on Reddit on the 18th of May.**


Not financial adv...yada yada bing bong. I am not from the US, so try to sue me for anything. I'll wear a tinfoil hat and defend myself. **Just an FYI: I'll refer to 'shorting' when I am talking about a superior put position. Given the past of the stock and the option anomalies, as well as typical SHF behavior, it is highly likely that superior put positions indicate a short position to drive the price down. Come at me.**


Well, let's dive into the city of Chicago, where the price is fake and shares are made up out of mayo.

So if you look very closely...

Yeah...no.

**Let me introduce you to the cast of The Chicago Code: Shitadel**


**Citadel aka Ken Griffin**


**Put Position: 3,271,400 worth $620,977,000 USD**

Did you like that? Yeah, you can't unsee that again. Thanks to our corporate photographer who just got hired for the next Zombie Apocalypse Movie, u/MrFerno


There is nothing to add to Ken Griffin here. He likes mayo, he likes shorts and he most likely likes to snort.

**IMC-Chicago LLC**


**Put Position: 1,708,200 worth $324,251,000 USD**


**Location: Chicago**


Apart from living down the road from Kenny Boy and being one of the largest funds with shorts on, they have ties to Shitadel. Remember how Citadel Securities is the designated market maker (DMM) for the NYSE picked for about 80% of the listings and 90% of the SPACs listed on NYSE?


​


![](/img/osld19hw3uz61.jpg)
Oh yeah, wonder how they got so big?

Ah yeah. Suspecthanna. [A very innocent 'group' that hasn't been fined for misreporting and mainpulation before.](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/oversight-enforcement/finra-disciplinary-actions?search=susquehanna&firms=&individuals=&field_fda_case_id_txt=&field_core_official_dt%5Bmin%5D=&field_core_official_dt%5Bmax%5D=&field_fda_document_type_tax=All) [(wb)](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/oversight-enforcement/finra-disciplinary-actions?search=susquehanna&firms=&individuals=&field_fda_case_id_txt=&field_core_official_dt%5Bmin%5D=&field_core_official_dt%5Bmax%5D=&field_fda_document_type_tax=All) We have talked about them plenty in the past, so I will just state them on here. Whenever there is any changes or chances to go against exchanges or the SEC, [they are on Citadel's side.](https://www.livemint.com/Money/jFcOxTTM1Eu8IC86ziDAyK/Options-market-makers-sue-exchanges-alleging-overcharges.html) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210518095322/https://www.livemint.com/Money/jFcOxTTM1Eu8IC86ziDAyK/Options-market-makers-sue-exchanges-alleging-overcharges.html)

And obviously, [they are one of the top $$$ provider for Robinhood](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/29/robinhood-citadel-gamestop-reddit/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210403163512/https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/29/robinhood-citadel-gamestop-reddit/) - which is basically as subsidiary of Citadel by now.

**Group One Trading L.P.**

Just another market financial institution based in Chicago that likes to [team up with Citadel](https://www.livemint.com/Money/jFcOxTTM1Eu8IC86ziDAyK/Options-market-makers-sue-exchanges-alleging-overcharges.html) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210518095322/https://www.livemint.com/Money/jFcOxTTM1Eu8IC86ziDAyK/Options-market-makers-sue-exchanges-alleging-overcharges.html).

**Wolverine Trading LLC**

Wolverine is another one. Well, where is the connection besides Chicago, the short position and expression of mutual interest?

**Equitec Proprietary Markets LLC**


**Put Position: 473,600 worth $89,899,000 USD**


**Location: Chicago**


Just another coincidence. I mean, they are just bearish on the same stock as all the other ones. They surely do not violate markets in the same way as Citadel, even leading to a citadel case being citied as [''comparable violations''](https://res-certification.cboe.com/resources/regulation/disciplinary/2019/Cboe--Equitec-Decision.pdf) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210518095318/https://res-certification.cboe.com/resources/regulation/disciplinary/2019/Cboe--Equitec-Decision.pdf) by CBOE?


​


![](/img/qr61ghdqguz61.png)


Oh and by the way, the first name, Consolidated Trading LLC. Well, remember them from above? Oddly they always come up with all the other names on any document that relates to violations and changes.


![](/img/hrlzdm99huz61.png)


Oh while we are seeing this screenshot.


**CTC Trading Group, LLC, also known as CTC LLC, is betting against Gamestop as well. Not big time, just a measly 2,700,000$. DRW Securities, LLC as well, though they are generally a bit more bullish**.


*Both located in Chicago of course.*

**UBS Group AG**


**Put Position: 753,300 worth $142,991,000**


**Location: Chicago (at least one of their main US branches.**


UBS and Citadel switch employees on a regular basis. Seriously, google it. This time I won't do it for you. But this is not what's important. Citadel is long on UBS, UBS is short on GME. Just another small connection. They are also working together on major projects, such as the [Miami International Holding](https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/miami-international-holdings-reports-2020-trading-results-market-share-and-volume-records-for-miax-exchange-group-837845603.html) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210518095311/https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/miami-international-holdings-reports-2020-trading-results-market-share-and-volume-records-for-miax-exchange-group-837845603.html), who owns the MIAX Exchange.

(MIH) is the parent holding company of Miami International Securities Exchange, LLC (MIAX®), MIAX PEARL, LLC (MIAX PEARL®) and MIAX Emerald, LLC (MIAX Emerald™ and together with MIAX and MIAX PEARL, the MIAX Exchange Group™), three options trading exchanges.

**Oh, while we are at it. See Simplex Trading LLC in those documents regarding MIAX?**


**Ah yeah, you guessed it. Based in Chicago and Short on GME. At least $15,500,000 USD.**


**Let's go for a few smaller ones as well:**


**- CSS LLC, chicago, put position of 71000**


**- Walleye Capital, chicago, put position of 127,400 worth $24,183,000**

**Goldman Sachs Group INC**

Citadel is long on Goldman Sachs and has [hired numerous new employees from Goldman Sachs in the past months.](https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/2020/08/citadel-hiring-from-goldman-sachs) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210408192409/https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/2020/08/citadel-hiring-from-goldman-sachs)

I want to highlight one more player here because it seems like Ken Griffin is his idol.


HAP Trading LLC with Harsh Padia, with an gigantic retarded position of 1,279,700 shares in puts. Why is there a connection? Because he is being slapped over and over by the CBOE located in Chicago for violations that Citadel has been violated for as well - [options manipulations.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-options-manipulation-fine-idUKBREA4B0XC20140512) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210518095304/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-options-manipulation-fine-idUKBREA4B0XC20140512)

Now if you have made it till here, congratulations.


I have a challenge for you. Pick a stock where Citadel has a major position. Now remember the names I posted above. When you see that Citadel is long, check what side the above are on. Are they betting the same way or against?


​


![](/img/tdi447eonuz61.png)
Hint: It's not surprising at all.


Just a quick one here for a random stock ''SOS Ltd.''


I picked a stock that nobody knows to illustrate that they aren't following a trend in the market, but each other. **ALL OF THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE SHORT ON GME.**


![](/img/fovx01nvnuz61.png)
TLDR? 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 A lot of speculation. A lot of yada yada. I like crayons, especially the green ones because they are healthier.


Real TLDR: Coincidentally, most HFs short are from Chicago and have ties to Citadel.
