THE ONLY RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION IS FILING A WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT WITH THE SEC IF THESE PRICES HAPPENED TO YOU; <https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210410162009/https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower)

Dear Apes,


​


As many of you know, there are multiple reports coming in from various ex-Robinhood apes showing at which prices their shares had to be bought and found in order to finish their transfer to other brokers.


​


My Theory is based on this Hypothesis: <https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngx2ag/hypothesis_robinhood_is_currently_buying_the_gme/> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210520183403/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngx2ag/hypothesis_robinhood_is_currently_buying_the_gme/)


​


Now from the numbers we see, RH paying upwards of 300 USD per share, we can be sure they are buying them from dark pools, not the open market as the price in the open market was multiples below the price they paid.


​


If Citadel is the Designated Market Maker for GME and Robinhood buys their fake-ass shares to close the CFDs they have given out, that would massively increase the on balance capital citadel has, thus making a margin call harder to pull of.


​


Let's try to speculate some ballpark numbers: If we estimate a SI% of 200 to 400% the total Float (2x-4x) and half of these shares are from Robinhood traders switching away, that means citadel might have been paid 1x-2x the float in shares at inflated prices of 300+ USD. Lets go with 1.5x the float for the calculation.


​


30.000.000*300 = 9.000.000.000 USD


​


Now that's a sum and its the conservative of all calculations. Given that Robinhood severely postponed their IPO while also benefiting immensely from the crypto + stock trading volatility in Q1 of this year, its reasonable to expect they


A. Could have that money


B. Are incentivised (or forced, this is not the first time they are lying) to pay this premium to keep their Nr.1 Customer


C. Postpone their IPO in order to delay the filing of any information regarding this shady transaction


​


FYI, I am just a meming europoor so if anyone has any counter thesis or even better data that would disprove my theory, let them come my way ASAP as I am just as interested as the next ape to uncover the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.


​


**TL:DR: I am SPECULATING that RH is buying counterfeit shares from Citadel to increase their capital balance. There is a motive and some proof backing up this theory, but no definitive confirmation.**


**As always, BUY, HODL, VOTE**


​


**EDIT 1:** HOLY SHIT I got so many downvotes in the first few seconds but real upvotes are fighting back. Go Superstonk! Oh and btw, if you are still on Robinhood you're not retarded, you're just really fucking stupid.


**EDIT 2:** Fresh from Bloomberg: ROBINHOOD - STARTING TO ROLL OUT IPO ACCESS, A PRODUCT THAT WILL GIVE USERS OPPORTUNITY TO BUY SHARES OF COS AT THEIR IPO PRICE, BEFORE TRADING BEGINS. Ask yourself in a world where banks make money from the IPO pop and scam everyone but themselves, why would Robinhood offer customers to buy their stock at the full IPO price before the IPO? Sounds like someone is pretty afraid of shit hitting the fan on IPO day LOL


**EDIT 3:** Good question by fellow ape /u/Si5584 . Anyone got any ideas/theories?

EDIT 6: Fellow Ape /u/HubKap1853 has posted the following article about the whole situation with the OCC: <https://tokenist.com/recent-occ-regulatory-moves-indicate-gme-amc-short-sellers-may-go-bust/> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210520195538/https://tokenist.com/recent-occ-regulatory-moves-indicate-gme-amc-short-sellers-may-go-bust/)


I just want to stress something: While we can agree with what is being said in this article, it is NOT an unbiased news source. The author works for an investment company that certainly has motivations. Possible conflict of interest here. Just saying, good news is good news but biased news are biased news.
