The first battle for the HFs is to prevent the MOASS, the next will be to get you to sell early when the MOASS starts. **Every single dirty trick on this list can and will be used again once the MOASS starts, and I would expect it to be spread to every single GME related sub.**

They have the deep pockets.


They have the technology.


They have the experts.
