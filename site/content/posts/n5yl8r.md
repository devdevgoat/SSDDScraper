MY **THEORY**: u/Leenixus was almost certainly correct in [Thinking that "They" got margin called today](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5trot/i_dont_to_tout_the_horn_without_knowing_anything/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210506050801/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5trot/i_dont_to_tout_the_horn_without_knowing_anything).


In After Hours 1M shares seemed to "disappear" from EOD Volume before "reappearing" in the EOD Volume later before AH close. I BELIEVE this is because Citadel got margin called @ 1127 today and therefor those 1M shares traded had to be re-routed or re-done or what have you. I can't be certain. I don't know if that's a thing or not but the concept makes a LOT of sense.

PART 1: INTRODUCTION TO THE THEORY
==================================


In case you live under a rock and don't spend every minute during trading hours staring at the $GME ticker & refreshing r/superstonk, today there was a 5 minute market wide trading halt from 1127-1132. There was also a case of 1M shares disappearing off of EOD (end of day) volume in AH (afterhours).

I was reading [This Post by Leenixus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5trot/i_dont_to_tout_the_horn_without_knowing_anything/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210506050801/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5trot/i_dont_to_tout_the_horn_without_knowing_anything) about how he has a theory Citadel got margin called today. Well, ***I think you're right*** u/Leenixus. Let me explain why.

PART 2: RUNNING THE NUMBERS
===========================


I looked at what the volume was when the market got halted at 1127.

Lets add this into a calculator

Compare this to the AH candle again:

PART 3: PICTURES OF THE EOD VOLUME BOUNCING FROM 2.7M TO 1.7M BACK TO 2.7M DURING AH
====================================================================================


​


Here's some pictures of the EOD volume not being at the "correct" 2.7M today during AH:

PART 4: EXTRA STUFFING FOR YOUR TINFOIL HAT & CONFIRMATION BIAS
===============================================================


At the end of the day we Todd Barker, the head of Citadel's Surveyor Capital step down.

​


PART 5: WRAPPING IT ALL TOGETHER + TLDR
=======================================


1. Citadel Securities is one of the **main market makers**. Market makers route orders to the market.
2. When NYSE was halted for 5 minutes @ 1127, the total trade volume for $GME at the time was \~1M shares
3. It's estimated that $161.19 was the margin call trigger price today for the major short sellers of GME (This includes Citadel, theorized to be the biggest) The price was $162.32 when the market was halted
4. **In After Hours 1M shares seemed to "disappear" from EOD Volume before "reappearing" in the EOD Volume later before AH close. I BELIEVE this is because Citadel got margin called @ 1127 today and therefor those 1M shares traded had to be re-routed or re-done or what have you. I can't be certain. I don't know if that's a thing or not but the concept makes a LOT of sense.**

It took over a month for us learn Archegos got Margin Called. So there ***may*** not be confirmation/proof saying otherwise for this theory for awhile. Regardless, the numbers add up and the rabbit hole leads to kens back yard.


​


EDIT1:


I should mention that just because a margin call happens, does NOT mean an institution needs to cover all their positions etc. Institutions CAN satisfy a margin call by having enough capital in your "margin account" (unsure if this would be called the same thing for hedge funds). If you can't satisfy it that way, one of two things can happen


1. You buy securities to cover your short positions or
2. Get liquidated

EDIT3:


A very good point brought up by u/Jvic111 & my counter to it

[This may be another possible solution to the argument above alternative to my guess](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5vqnr/omfg_it_looks_like_all_of_shitadels_volume_was/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210506115406/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5vqnr/omfg_it_looks_like_all_of_shitadels_volume_was/)

My best guess against it: They started to run into problems because Citadel was in the process of getting margin called and it started to fuck with their processing due to the fact Citadel is one of the largest Market Makers for the NYSE. This would undoubtedly lead to difficulties processing orders/bids to the market <https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5v5m0/an_ape_explained_the_missing_1million_volume_i/> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210506144353/https://i.redd.it/rdh0uulscex61.jpg)
