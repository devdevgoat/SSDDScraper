---Ok guys I've been investing for awhile, Im not the most wrinkle brain but I've got a few... I've invested in long term value stock, dividend stocks, but my favorite type (before I YOLO'ed it all in Gamestop) was the sub-penny stocks... 


(Please hang in there while I explain the opposite of GME)


For all you smooth brain apes out there a sub-penny stock trades between .0001 and .0009 and you have the oppertunity to make alot of money.. (well what I thought was alot, before I realized the potential of GME) Let's say you buy 1,000,000 shares of a company at
.0001 for 1000$ and 2 days later you sell that stock for 
.0004. Guess what? you just made 3000 dollers. Pretty good huh... 


Well now your feeling pretty fucking good about what you just did... so you take all those tendies and confidence, and you wolf of wallstreet that shit into a cool million shares of another company at .0004 ($4000) then the next day it goes down 0003.. fuck, 0002, 0001. And you keep holding it..... you think it's going to go back up but it doesn't... Eventually you have had enough. You think ahh fuck, whatever, I'll just sell it at .0001 and get out with my initial investment, right?


(HA HA HA!! fuck no!)


Why not? Well sometimes with these types of stocks they go into what's called a no bid.... and that's when you are the bag holder in every sence of the word. You can put a sell order in at .0001 but it will not execute. Why? Because nobody wants to buy it.... Believe me I put a good till closed limit order in on one and that expired I did that 4 times before it finally sold... It took years BTW.....


(This is where Gamestop comes in and why it has almost unlimited potential if you HODL)



```
I was snacking on a box of 96 today and had an Apepiffiny... What happens when they need to buy but nobody is selling...

```

So, as all apes know by now, gamestop is shorted.... A Fuckton... 200% 300% 400% 1000% who knows? We will find out soon, either way.... The shorts MUST cover!! 



```
And this being the case, along with a new breed of traders (Apes with 💎✋).. The likes of which the market has never seen before....  Will put us in a unique situation that I don't believe has ever occured.....

```

In walks..... THE NO ASK!!!!


The Bid during the MOASS will just keep rising to the next ask .... 10,000 shares at 1000... Then 20,000 shares at 2000... So on and so forth till all the paper hands have folded. All that's left is a huge army of great 💎✋🦍... And all of the sudden, the ask is blank.... The last traded price is there. The shorts still need to cover so the Bid starts rising... above the last traded price, still the ask is blank... It keeps going and going and going until one of us apes decides, well that seems like a fair price for 10 shares. $20,000,000$ done... Ape sell 10.. his account has 200,000,000$. GME Price goes to 20,000,000 stock goes to no ask again, bid rises untill another ape decides to sell, 25mil, 30mil, 32mil, 40mil.. Untill all the shorts have covered


I'm not positive, but I don't believe volume will matter during the MOASS. The Bid will simply rise to the next ask and the shares will be bought... towards the end.. when the only shares left to cover are owned by Apes... I hope we all get to witness fellow apes HODLing.. with the No Ask...


I have only a few wrinkles and I'm not a financial advisor... Just a guy who has experienced the opposite of the situation we are currently in...


And my Tits are jacked....
