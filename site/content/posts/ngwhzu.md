---**Hello Fellow Apes,**


I am writing this post to let Apes know that I was able to follow-up through the SEC and the DTCC on **SR-DTC-2021-005** and to the follow-up on work in my initial post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mzkf8v/where_is_srdtc2021005/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210427091928/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mzkf8v/where_is_srdtc2021005/), and providing you now with the status update I received.


**I would also like to report that the SEC and the DTCC once again were very gracious and timely in their responses.**


For those not familiar with **SR-DTC-2021-005 and what it does.**


**In short, SR-DTC-2021-005** would limit the ability of market makers and hedge funds working together to reset FTD transactions and/or conceal short positions through nefarious options trading.


There are some great DD's on this rule by [u/bigbrainbets](https://www.reddit.com/u/bigbrainbets/) [(wb)](https://www.reddit.com/u/bigbrainbets/) ; [u/lighthouse30130](https://www.reddit.com/user/lighthouse30130/) [(wb)](https://www.reddit.com/user/lighthouse30130/), and others, and good follow-up work by [u/kamayatzee](https://www.reddit.com/u/kamayatzee/) [(wb)](https://www.reddit.com/u/kamayatzee/) .

Now,


Below is the chain of communication between myself , the SEC, and the DTCC on the whereabouts of SR-DTC-2021-005.


**TL:DR**


**SR-DTC-2021-005. was reviewed by the SEC. The filing is currently being finalized for filing at the DTCC. It will be filed shortly. And once it is filed, it becomes effective!!**


When the rule is filed it will be posted here with any other DTC rules on the DTCC website <https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings.aspx> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210412181351/https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings.aspx)
