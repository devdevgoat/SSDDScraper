I'm not gonna sit here and tinfoil hat, but c'mon they aren't even TRYING to hide they're Bullish on SPY shitting the bed. They're looking to profit when the MOASS fucking destroys the top side of the market. Its so blaringly obvious it hurts.

Not a PERFECT 1:1 but you'd need to be blind to say there's not something suspect here that deserves more attention.

EDIT 4:


JANUARY 11th $SPXS REVERSE STOCK SPLIT


![](/img/cwr3opgwdyt61.png)


Legit question for the more well versed folk out there. What happens if you are short shares that never existed, then they get combined into 1 share?


The fuck?


Historical values of some of these ETF's prior to 3 separate reverse Stock splits:

​


EDIT 5:


My Brain... ITS OVERFLOWING:


What if theory:


Inverse ETF's are designed to go DOWN. A Reverse Stock split is a KNOWN quantity to occur.


Hypothetical: If you Naked Short an Inverse ETF (synthetic shares), then you have a Reverse Stock Split happen (10 get combined into 1) in theory you got paid crazy money on a stock that no longer exists due to the nature of these reverse splits.

LOOK WHAT THIS IS MADE OUT OF:

EDIT 10:


Theory for Reverse Stock Splits on Inverse ETFs, and why the share price from 12 years ago is still alive today:


Consider this:


A reverse stock split on a regular ETF would be exactly that, a 1:2 - "Increasing" share value.


A regular stock split on a regular ETF would be exactly that, a 2:1 - "Decreasing" share value.


A reverse stock split on an Inverse ETF = 1:2 "Decreasing" share value.


A regular stock split on an Inverse ETF = 2:1 "Increasing" share value.


Remember, this is opposite day with these inverse ETF's. The act of reverse splitting is the same as a regular ETF's stock split, IE - more shares = same money.


Now its simply, Less shares = same money.


Due to how we all know that the ticker is NOT representative of the real price in a manipulated security it is incredibly easy to see how SPXS may be like a bundle of taut cords, about to snap but not readily apparent until it simply happens.


​


EDIT 11:


TA;DR -


SPXS goes down, SPY goes up.


SPXS goes up, SPY goes down.


GME correlates with SPXS movements.


If GME goes up, SPXS will go up, and SPY will go down.


Citadel & friends are HYPER Long on SPXS (and other Inverse ETF's) = Profit from GME Mooning. HODL will make all their profits get eaten tho by hungry apes.
