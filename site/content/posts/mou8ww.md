---**An overview of the deplorable Mr. Ken Griffin**


​


My fellow apes,


I believe it was Sun Tzu who said "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles." That is what we face every trading day, as the saga of GME continues.


I am keen to inform you further about the antagonist of this story (though I'm sure as a likely narcissistic psychopath he doesn't see it that way). I am talking about **Mr. Kenneth Cordele Griffin**, founder, chief executive officer, Co-chief investment officer, and 85% owner of Citadel LLC - a man estimated to have horded a wealth of **$22.4 billion**.


In case you are unaware, Citadel LLC are thought to be the primary short-sellers in the GME debacle, where they predatorially gave loans to Gabe Plotkin's company to prevent margin calls at the GME peak in late January of this year. Their relentless pursuit of profit has landed them in rather hot water this time, as I personally don't believe they ever wanted the public to be aware of their practices, nor they unbelievable amount of money they made at the cost of American jobs, businesses and livelihoods.


Given Mr. Griffin is both CEO and 85% owner of Citadel, I think it is only fair to say he guides the operations of his business, and the operations are therefore reflective of his values. If you agree, it is therefore fair to attribute praise/blame (99% the latter) to the man who oversees all in this company.


So, please join me in reviewing Mr. Griffin as a man, in both his personal and business affairs. In doing this research, I have personally been sickened by what sort of a man has risen to the top of the US pyramid, but I will leave it for your deliberation - enjoy:


​


**Personal life**


Bought the most expensive home in the US ever ($238m penthouse in NY), money that could have been used to help millions of others out of poverty, or maybe pay for almost 1000 $250,000 homes for those affected by the 2008 crash:

​


Oh wait, more multimillion dollar houses because of course you need those:

​


Owns $800m+ in art, instead of giving it to charity or allowing it to circulate through the economy:

​


Griffin owns **two** private jets: a 2001 [Bombardier Global Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_Global_Express) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210302051012/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_Global_Express) valued at $9.5 million, and a $50 million 2012 Bombardier Global 6000, so he hates the environment too:

​


He HATES being taxed, because having a fair amount of money would be unfair apparently:

​


He believes that people should be able to make unlimited contributions to politicians, but that these contributions should be public (P.S. USA wake up - this 'lobbying' disproportionately ensures rich people can trample you further)

​


Allegedly forced his second wife to sign prenuptial agreement from which he benefitted financially:

​


Refused to pay alimony, and threatened to sue ex-wife into the ground:

​


Oh, and he's got a real temper like all well-adjusted folks:

​


He even smashed up furniture when his wife threatened to break up with him (she made a good choice):

​


He doesn't do philanthropy because he is a good person; he does them for tax write-offs so jot that one down:

​


​


**Business**


From the start, he's far more likely to be a psychopath, and all of my reading has supported this (he is horrific to work for and as a person):

​


He doesn't do empathy:

​


A prideful man, who bragged in 2015 that Citadel "[manufactures money](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadels-ken-griffin-leaves-2008-tumble-far-behind-1438655887) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210411212224/https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadels-ken-griffin-leaves-2008-tumble-far-behind-1438655887) like an automaker manufactures cars"

​


He's living his best life pretending he's the 'Navy SEALS' of Finance (grandiose and delusional):

​


Suspicious location of subsidiary company Palafox in the Cayman Islands (coincidentally a tax haven hmm). They are also prepared to collapse the world economy and indirectly kill thousands to make a quick buck:

​


Like a typical hedge fund/investment bank, Citadel doesn't give a s**t about your work/life balance with 80+ hour workweeks:

​


On top of this, they treat employees terribly, hence the high turnover (ex-Citadel employees, make him pay using the second link):

​


Tries to psych out his employees with long pauses and weird rituals because he's awful:

​


Wanted to be a whistle-blower/snitch, which was presumably done for a competitive advantage, not for altruism/respect of the law:

Citadel PROFITED on the 2008 crash:

​


Citadel accepts these fines as they aren't high enough to be a deterrent (no shame at all eh lads?):

​


**And this is just the stuff we know. I'm sure even worse occurs behind closed doors. KEN GRIFFIN HATES YOU.**


Overall, Ken Griffin was likely hoping he would never be in the limelight, but here we are (BTW please share this far and wide so people know how much of a deplorable piece of s**t scumbag he is). He is, both in business and pleasure, a disgusting, greedy, angry, cheating human being who deserves to be in jail without a cent to his name. GME is your last chance to even get close to punishing these people. The American system has ensured the ivory towers of smoke and mirrors are built, and the final bricks that will ensure invincibility lie here - KNOCK THE CITADEL DOWN AND USE THE BRICKS TO BUILD HOMES, SCHOOLS AND HOSPTIALS.


*If anyone has any more additions/changes (there will be loads because he's truly detestable), please message me and I will edit.*


Thank you for reading. Please GME to the moon, and hopefully Ken to jail 🚀🚀🚀


*Edited for readability*
