---Hello there fellow apes. I have decided that with a new sub should come new DD and so I have decided to write this article. Now some of you may remember me from my last article where I talked about the suspicious amount of companies that went bankrupt under the rule of the ousted members who may or may not have been planted there in order to insure GMEs failure.

Since then I have remained in the shadows upvoting and occasionally commenting on posts but mostly just watching things unfold and Hodling. But I have decided to come out of hiding to share some of the insights that I feel that I have found after analyzing the level 2 book on webbull and witnessing the spectacular growth of this subreddit. Now my claim in the title as to why 1 million is not as crazy as it seems is meant genuinely and is not simply clickbait for three major reasons. The first being the large amount of retail/active investors in the stock, the second is the level 2 book which shows how once this rocket gets going things are going to start getting insane and the final reason being an analysis of the game theory involved within this transaction.


Keep in mind I will be recapping some information covered by other DD in order to backup/verify every assertion and point made. "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence" which in this case means a lot of evidence needs to be provide to show each point is true. With that out of the way lets talk about how much of the stock is owned by retail.

**Chapter 1: Retail Ownership and the Prisoners Dilemma**


Now for the last few months a lot of questions have been thrown around as to how much the stock is shorted and as to how much of the outstanding stock is owned by retail. The reason being is simple. If retail (more specifically the guys asking for a milli a share) own 100% of the stock and the stock is shorted basically at all then that means they have to pay whatever that guy wants them to pay. That being said if the short interest is low only a few guys are actually going to be paid that million a share. Even if retail does not own all the outstanding so long as we own a significant proportion of it and refuse to sell below a certain price the other players so to speak will understand this and will raise their floors to something more similar to are own. This is vital to understand as it is part of the basis of this due diligence.


Now let us look at some speculation as to how much of the outstanding is owned by retail


This article by u/DiamondApes 23 days ago speculates that **40.8 Million shares are owned by retail**. He calculated this by looking at several major brokers and then multiplying the overall percent of users involved in GME from each broker with the average investment size from each.

â€‹


This article by u/SpacedSlayer 24 days ago speculates that retail owns **100% of GME Outstanding shares.** The argument here is rather speculative but effectively the author creates a table to represent how many different owners there would be at certain price points by dividing the overall outstanding shares by the number of owners at different levels.

â€‹


This article by u/InForTheSqueeze 19 days ago speculates that at a minimum retail owns **between 100%-1000%.** After gathering together data from about 20 different brokers he then multiplied that by the percent of users on these brokerages that own GME. If apes own only 5 shares he calculates retail would own **more than 150%**. Keep in mind though that the percent of users on each brokerage is rather speculative as it is based on information provided by some firms on the % of users invested in GME and then extrapolated to others by way of what type of firm they are.

This article by u/cbkguy talks about how fidelity customer support has had **half a million accounts transfer from Robinhood to fidelity.** What is important to note here is that this is only fidelity that is saying they have 500 million accounts transfer it does not include other brokerages which might have also received customers transferring accounts. It is also important to note that although accounts which transfer are more likely to have contained GME or AMC it is also extremely likely that the decision to prevent buying or selling cost them a great deal of clients which did not own either stock

Now as much as it is important to keep morale up it is also important to stick to the facts and not let our own hopes influence our decision making. The reason why so many of us are hesitant to talk to friends or family about each share being worth one million is because it is inherently a ridiculous proposition to begin with. We have to be able to prove each step on our chain of reasoning because if we have a single misstep or guess the argument loses its credibility. Now as some of you may have noted these articles from these excellent due diligences do contain some speculations and are also about 20 days old as of writing. However a very important thing to note is that despite these articles containing some speculation most are based on hard facts and logic even more importantly **each piece of due diligence I have listed comes at the problem from a different angle**. If you look at what is being said you have 4 different authors attempting to solve the problem using different methods and metrics and each one seems to point in the same direction. That strikes me as very bullish. I have included links to each author and have included what I believe to be potential speculations on their part above.


Now before we continue I would like to add in one more metric of my own that I have been using to track potential GME share holders. That being the amount of users on GME specific subreddits and also how active users have been on those subreddits.


First let us examine the overall size of the original GME subreddit


â€‹


![](/img/p5vaj9sm4nr61.png)


As can be seen we were over **250k users on this subreddit alone** as of two days ago. Now this is still extremely bullish considering first of all that users who join this subreddit with the exception of bots are extremely likely to own shares of GME.


Next lets look at r/wallstreetbets


![](/img/78c5378b5nr61.png)


Now as you can guess that vertical line represents the date of the original rise in the GME price. Many retail and institutional investors realized that this was the place to be and decided to check out what was going on in this subreddit. However it is important to note that prior to the questionable actions of their moderation community, GME was the stock of the subreddit and all the posts there were in refrence to it. After the growth of the forum it gradually shifted into a more open environment and it is extremely optimistic to say that there are 9.7 million apes . In addition as time has dragged on there have been questions as to how many individuals have paperhanded over time or just decided to go into other plays. As to avoid speculation the biggest takeaway from this chart is that there were roughly 2 million people on the subreddit the GME movement we saw in early January and it seems likely that this initial group has either grown or has remained of a similar size throughout this entire debacle. **This indicates that there are likely upwards of 2 million individual GME shareholders** being conservative


Finally lets look at r/Superstonk


![](/img/ustqxg1x5nr61.png)


Now after the mass exodus that occurred over at the original GME forum we have a new data point to examine. It is important to note that this data compliments the graph provided earlier by the original GME post. This is because the users gained on this subreddit were ones who transferred from GME. What I have concluded from this data is that people are not paperhanding as much as we might think. It is difficult to say from the GME data whether or not the 250k number represents just people who have at one point invested and then left or if that also includes bots/shills but this data indicates that the indivduals on GME and now also r/SuperStonk are extremely active and bullish. Included below are photos from my phone during the initial transfer of users to Superstonk.

â€‹


Now the important info here might seem minor but is a rather major bullish indicator to me. **By 4:51 AM 30,712 users had joined** r/Superstonk**. By 8:09 am that number had increased to 66,092 members.** Within hours of information regarding potentially negative actions taken by the moderation team becoming public a new forum was located and transfered too. (As of editing it is important to note that I am a hour behind the NYSE times so relatively it would be 5:51 am and 9:09 AM) . The takeaway I thought was most important was that there was a **high level of homogeneity within our community**. Not that we all act a like or that we encourage acting in a specific manner but that we tend to act as a group as a result of our individual choices. This might not seem relevant now but it will play a large role in the conclusion of this DD.


TLDR: There are a lot of apes and each one owns enough that we own the float if not all the shares outstanding


â€‹


**Chapter 2: Short Interest and the Level 2 Book**


Now the question that is most important is how much of the stock is actually shorted. **If you have been following the situation and reading the DD every day go ahead and skip past this part** but otherwise it is a refresher for those who might be questioning if short interest still exists in the stock and it helps to serve as a stepping stone for the conclusion of this DD.


If there were no shorts on the stock then our play while fine from a fundamental standpoint where we invest in the future of GME will likely not be worth a million dollars per share any time soon. The gamble that our trade is betting on is that the Short interest of this stock is high enough that they will be forced to cover at whatever price we set. A short squeeze occurs when there are no shares available to purchase except at ridiculously price points.


Now I will be frank the information out there regarding short interest is simply not accurate from the official sources. We have seen miles of foul play from the Hedge funds and the only sources of short interest that retail is provided is either given by research firms (Who as of writing have now announced they are no longer going to be providing SI numbers) and FINRA who is a self reporting agency who has changed their metrics regarding the calculation of short interest during this time period

That being said there is still significant evidence to show the existence of short interest in GME


This article written by u/Unowned-Instruction seems to indicate that the Short interest is **Upwards of 2000%.** The article focuses on the presence of naked shorting effectively **Naked shorting is the practice of shorting a stock when the underlying asset being shorted does not exist.** I could summarize the article here like I have for the others but it is extremely detailed and I fear I would get details wrong or butcher the points made by the author by trying to summarize. I would highly recommend you read

This article written by u/HeyItsPixeL discusses how firms are using **ETFS in order to short GME** without it appearing in official paperwork. The main one **XRT had such an extremely high short interest such that it was 200% short** during the time of writing. Effectively by using an ETF they are able to short the stocks within that ETF without otherwise being forced to disclose that the shares being sold are related to any individual stock within that ETF.

This article written by u/Animasoul and posted by u/PIanetary covers how **Short Selling a positive beta stock will cause the beta to go negative**. Beta represents how much a stock will move relative to the overall market. The average beta on a stock is 1 since the average movement of the market to itself is itself.Since the writing of this article 21 days ago the beta has gone from -8 to -20. This number is so ridiculously high that I cannot think of a single logical explanation as to how this possibly could exist except for the presence of short selling

Now I could go on and on with evidence for the existence of short interest however there are plenty of DD out there that discuss why they exist and how much is speculated to exist. Furthermore it is not the purpose of this DD to prove the existence of short interest merely to provide enough evidence to form the building blocks of my argument. If you would like to verify the DD that indicates the existence of short interest and other factors there is a list that has all the available evidence and speculation and theories that has been posted over the last few months.

**If you skipped ahead past the short interest recap continuation begins here**


Now I included the information on SI simply because I want to be extremely thorough in this DD and want to insure that each claim I make here is well researched and has a basis in reality. The more important portion of this chapter comes from the Level 2 book.


Now for those of you who aren't familiar the Level 2 book is a list of the bids and asks on a certain stock and generally includes the volume at each price point. So for example if you look on the left side of the level 2 book you will see the price someone is willing to buy at and how many they are willing to buy at that price. Likewise if you look at the right side you will see how many shares someone is willing to sell and at what price. Now I have been personally watching the level 2 book provided by webull for the last few months keep in mind that this data does not include all trades or offers but it does show a variety of interesting pieces of information.


First on the existence of trading algorithms. After watching this stock for the last few months you begin notice little patterns. One of the best signs of algorithmic trading is noticing interesting sizes for bids and asks being consistent.


â€‹


![](/img/f32a1tiwonr61.png)


As you might have noticed the number 23 is quite common. Now I have been watching this level 2 book for a few weeks now and can tell you that the most common time you see these strange occurances of numbers is during low volume periods. They try and go for unusual numbers for a while 7 shares was the go to number for the algos but as of this post ( taken today 4/6/2021) 23 seems to be the golden number of the day. Now keep in mind I could provide other examples of this occuring but this illustrates my point and I would rather not dig through 1344 hours of footage just to provide a clearer example of algorithmic trading. It is important to note that when these unusual numbers appear the stock usualy either stagnates at its price point or goes down which indicates to me that this is a large fund or more likely multiple large funds using algos to manipulate the prices up and down.


â€‹


Now while the existence of bots is obviously alarming it isn't anything to worry about so long as we hold and in fact I only mention it because another DD I planned on writing but didnt involved these screenshots. No the important information can be very clearly seen in this image


![](/img/uwvdlbckqnr61.png)


Now I have been watching this stock and others on the level 2 books for weeks now and it isnt unusual to see a high or low number on the books every now and then. But those **extremely high numbers on the ask side** appear almost all the time on GME. If you watch this stock for more than 5 minutes at any given point in the day you will almost always see some ludicrously high number show up in the level 2 book. Consider if you will that the level 2 book reflects all available asks and bids that the broker (in this case webull) can see open in the market. In theory if this was all available asks then all that would be required to start the squeeze would be that you purchase all the asks above that number at one time. But unfortunately that is not the case. In reality there are almost certainty asks on other level 2 books which show values between 188.65 and 4500 and there is serious evidence of manipulation within the level 2 books due to the existence of ALO orders which allow for the creation of walls in the level 2 book. The main takeaway from this is that once an actual squeeze begins to occur and the shorts are forced to cover the price is going to rise ridiculously quickly. We joke about rockets on these subs all the time but this is going to be a pole going straight up when it occurs.


TLDR: Insane amounts of short interest. Evidence of manipulation of official sources. Indications of serious algorithmic trading going on in level 2 book, and rocket ship could bolt up $1000 at any given catalyst.


**Chapter 3: Tying it all together, Apes and the Prisoners Dilemma**


So now all the evidence has been gathered and its time to tie it all together. Keep in mind the claim I am making with this DD is that **1 Million per share is not only possible but probable.** So lets recap what we already know. Apes likely own either the entire shares outstanding or at minimum the float of the stock. Shorters have gone banana's shorting the stock and the SI indicates that they owe way more than can be provided. The level 2 book shows both evidence of algorithms trading the stock and also that the ask side of the stock is so flimsy that on a dime the stock could rise thousands of dollars.


So after adding this all together it all ends up coming down to what the Apes do. Institutions do play a role but whenever a stock is possibly 2000% shorted you can bet that even if every institution sells (BTW institutions own 200% according to bloomberg terminal) before us the shorters will eventually have to come to us and buy every single share that every ape owns in order to fix their short positon. Even if some apes do decide to paperhand out and miss out on the MOASS it still will not be enough in order to fix their issue apes still get to set the prices for their shares regardless of paperhands. The only way out of this for the shorters is to come and buy as many shares as they shorted. Now for those of you who are thinking to yourself hey I'm all in for the squeeze but 1 Million is ridiculous there is no way its going to get that high maybe itll hit 1k or 10k or even 100k if we are lucky. You guys are missing several key things that are going to occur once the squeeze starts happening.


**First** many many people are going to start FOMO (Fear of missing out) into the stock once it starts to seriously rise. Remember that the reason why the brokerages restricted trading wasnt to stop the squeeze from occuring it was to stop investors from buying shares that they needed in order to cover and also to provide a smoke screen for them getting in position to destroy the share value and give themselves enough time to cover their asses.


**Second** of all once the squeeze starts we are not going to be seeing a linear increase in the value of the shares we hold, it will be exponential. As you can see from the level 2 book data (second photo in that section) once the squeeze begins the only shares they will be able to purchase will be ones that are at those ridiculous price points in the thousands and it will jump there extremely quickly. Not only that but the shorters that were able to hold on will be slaughtered as their margins will go up to ridiculous levels and they will be forced to cover ( Or more likely the DTCC) . **It is important to note that people will be selling some shares on the way up but apes will likely be putting in their asks at the maximum values that their brokerages allow. This means that once we get moving up the price will increase by the maximum amount allowed by certain brokerages. They are forced to buy at whatever price is available to them regardless of what that price is. That is why we will see exponential growth**.


**Third** the tricks they used to stop the short squeeze last time were temporary and cannot be used again. That's not to say they dont have new tricks but apes have migrated from Robinhood and other iffy brokerages that shut down during the blockage and Apes have held through thick and thin and continue to do so despite all the wacked stuff we have been seeing going on. Not only that but once the squeeze gets going we are going to see quite a few more primate companions join us on the way up to the moon/andromeda


Now its important to know that we are not in a prisoners dilemma right now. They have shorted so much of the stock that they cannot avoid paying out unless we all sell. Even if we lose a few paper handers in the thousands or tens of thousands it wont matter. So long as enough of us refuse to sell for anything below a million the stock price will increase exponentially towards that million dollar value as people put in trades for the maximum possible values with their brokerages. The only play that these shorters have left is to make us think we are in a prisoners dillemma. You ever notice why the term bagholder became such a critical piece of their narrative. It was to shift our attention from them and focus our attention on the idea that our fellow apes would betray us rather than cooperate. But as the evidence has shown time and time again we have refused to play that game and I do not see any reason why that would shift once it becomes obvious to even non apes the position the shorters are in.


Jeez this is long so ill keep the conclusion short


**In conclusion 1 Million per share is not a meme**


â€‹


TLDR: Stock will increase exponentially not linearly when it increases this means that 1 million per share is more likely than many people currently think.
