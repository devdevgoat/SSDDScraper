---Okay, I've been typing all day and sipping coffee all night, so strap in for my crayon drawings.


**Citadel and Point72 have owned at least 51% (controlling interest) in Melvin Capital since January 24th (through a private placement investment/unregistered offering) following Melvin receiving notice that their broker/dealer had margin called them.** Let me explain.


<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-melvin/melvin-capital-ends-month-with-over-8-billion-in-assets-after-investors-added-cash-source-idUSKBN2A00KW> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210416205527/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-melvin/melvin-capital-ends-month-with-over-8-billion-in-assets-after-investors-added-cash-source-idUSKBN2A00KW)


Not that I think anyone should read or trust Reuters (or any source for that matter, even me) but they have been an interesting source to evaluate since January.


In the above article (posted Jan 31st) it's stated that a "-Source" (sus af trust no one haha) disclosed that Melvin Capital ended the month with over $8 Billion in assets under management (AUM).


Traditional AUM reporting includes positions purchased with margin; so that $8 billion reported includes margin positions, **it doesn't include short positions because a short's loss isn't realized until the position is closed, on the contrary, proceeds from a short position can be used freely to purchase positions that will be shown on AUM**. There is also a term called regulatory AUM which means the $ amount value of assets managed by a fund when accounting for losses in unclosed positions and tracks margin but big surprise funds don't offer this number publicly.


There are two possibilities as of Jan 31st:


Reuters "Source" purposefully leaked the $8B number to suggest Melvin was worth more than $5.5B at the time of Citadel and Point 72's combined $2.75B share equity purchase.


or


That $8B number is the amount of capital Melvin had after gaining access to more leverage using the $2.75B. If you remove the $2.75B "infusion" from the total $8B AUM reported it's $5.25B, **exactly half of $5.25B is $2.625B. Meaning, if Melvin raised funds at a valuation $5.25B, a $2.75B investment would be able to purchase controlling interest through a private placement investment.**


**I believe That $8B number represents Melvin Capital's AUM after a $2.75B "infusion" and any margin they were able to gain access to between Jan 24th and Jan 31st. This would develop a narrative that Melvin did not have to sell controlling interest in the company to raise capital to prevent a bankruptcy.**


**Citadel and Point72 purchased more than half of the existing funds share equity, and even if unleveraged, that $2.75B accounted for 1/3rd of the total assets under management as of Jan 31. The links below will explain some of the nuances to private placement investments.**

" A securities offering exempt from registration with the SEC is sometimes referred to as a *private placement* or an *unregistered offering*."


"[Hedge funds](http://investor.gov/news-alerts/hedge-funds) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603214755/https://www.investor.gov/news-alerts/hedge-funds) and other private funds also engage in private placements."


**When investing through a private placement, the investor is essentially purchasing equity shares in that company. Owning more than 50% of a company's equity shares means you have controlling interest in that company.**


"The majority shareholder's controlling interest means he or she has more voting power and can influence the company's strategic direction and operation"

Okay so, remember January? it was only a few decades ago right?


**Between January 26th and January 28th GOOG fell from $1917 to $1830;**


**Between January 26th and January 29th FICO fell from $511 to $450.**


**Between January 26th and January 29th AMZN fell from $3,326 to $3,206**


**Melvin had/has big positions in all those stocks**. **I think these drops are all the result of Melvin Capital receiving a margin call but they stayed holding positions acquired with cash.**


When a margin call takes place, the broker/dealer often uses software/algorithms to close out the positions meaning that a computer will buy at **LITERALLY ANY PRICE WITHIN A SPECIFIED RANGE**. I believe this attempted margin call (I'll explain why I call it an attempted margin call) contributed greatly to the buying pressure and run up to $483. "Technical issues" such as partial GME shares selling for over $2k may have resulted from this attempted margin call (also maybe not, just can't explain this any other way):

Remember Plotkin said in the hearing that he didn't think the price action was influenced by shorts covering; I still believe he knew that covering their entire short position would send the stock much, much higher and break the financial system which we might have seen if the buy stoppage did not occur.


As will take place when the MOASS occurs, the broker/dealer (remember we don't know where Melvin bought their shorts, it could very well be Citadel, or another completely random broker/MM) who lent to Melvin would've had to decide to bankrupt themselves to attempt to cover and realized **covering without going bankrupt was impossible.** Only way to avoid bankruptcy was to require Melvin to locate adequate funding and along came Citadel and Point72 to "pro-actively contribute" $2.75B to prevent further margin call of Melvin through private placement.


This is likely because whenever Melvin's broker/lender realized shit was hitting the fan they may have attempted to margin call Melvin's naked short position on GME; only to realize they **literally can't cover it even with a margin call due to unavailable float since we now know available float is 26M.** (what I meant by "attempted margin call")


If we look at the recent situation involving Archegos Capital, we can observe that the ability to acquire ridiculously risky leverage is fairly easy for bigger funds/big money (and just think Archegos was a "family office" lol). <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/leveraged-blowout-how-hwang-s-archegos-blindsided-global-banks> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210403212224/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/leveraged-blowout-how-hwang-s-archegos-blindsided-global-banks)


Reading that article would suggest that Archegos could have held a total portfolio of up to $100B because **"the lenders couldn’t see that Hwang was taking parallel positions at multiple firms"**.


It also mentions that Credit Suisse took (at a minimum) a $4B (some total estimates up to $10B total) hit after margin calling Archegos (**4x their annual income generated by their largest sector**; the real estate side), which shows why a broker/dealer may be hesitant to margin call since they can get burned really fucking bad, if say... their client is stupid overleveraged and used the loans you gave them as collateral to gain more leverage (that actually happened fucking lol).


Looking at the most recent Fintel summary for Melvin Capital. I think they could be trying to create the illusion of growth by acquiring more margin:


<https://fintel.io/i/melvin-capital-management-lp> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210422093456/https://fintel.io/i/melvin-capital-management-lp)


First thing to observe is that they are listing a **total asset portfolio of $22B as of 12/31/2020.** [**https://fintel.io/i13fs/melvin-capital-management-lp**](https://fintel.io/i13fs/melvin-capital-management-lp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210315160124/https://fintel.io/i13fs/melvin-capital-management-lp)


[**https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/hedge-fund-melvin-capital-posts-first-quarter-decline-of-49**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/hedge-fund-melvin-capital-posts-first-quarter-decline-of-49) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210417103322/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/hedge-fund-melvin-capital-posts-first-quarter-decline-of-49)


**Wait, so a fund that had $22B under management on 12/31/2020 only had $8B on 01/31/2021 AFTER receiving a $2.75B "cash infusion" on the 01/24? From this it can be observed that between 12/31/2020 and 01/31/2021 Melvin lost a MINIMUM $14B and could have lost well up to $16.25B total assets if that $8B includes leveraged gained using the $2.75B from Kenny and Stevie-boy. IMO $15B loss on a $22B fund sounds like a margin call to me**


We can also see that Melvin is still reporting positions as of 03/19/2021. So they are still in business and still purchasing stock, but we can observe that *their website is down (u/Sh0w3n pointed out this is a misunderstanding on my part, the website has had that blankish display screen well before I or other apes noticed it) and their phone line is down*. Doesn't mean they've closed their doors but I will say it reminds me of a business transition that might take place when a business is "under new management".

But they have renewed their SEC registration this past march: <https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210323235714/https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf)


Looking at their SEC filings can shed some light of this, We can notice Melvin's behavior as a fund change by observing certain position changes between Q4 2020 - Q1 2021


If we compare Melvin Capitals SEC quarterly reports side by side; we can see that Melvin has without a doubt gained access to more capital through short selling. **A quick glance at the position differences on these reports and it doesn't even look like the same fund**:


2020 Q4: <https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210202020640/https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml)


2021 Q1:


<https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571821000248/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210328203821/https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571821000248/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml)


**Deductions I made from the QoQ report comparison,** **keep in mind the most recent FINTEL report reflects the positions value on 31/01/2020 when GME was $19.50 (when I'm writing this GME is $177.77 so Melvin is at least 8x as fuk as they were in December 2020).**


. **Put position in GME increased by 600,000 shares from October 2020 - December 2020 but value of put position (amount outstanding) has more than doubled from $55M to $113M.**


. **AMD position increased by 1.6M shares, from 2.1M to 3.7M**


. **MSFT position decreased by 100k shares**


. **COMPLETELY NEW 6.4M share put position in Mylan Pharma (Ticker:VTRS) on 12/31/2020. VTRS stock has been hammered down significantly Feb 19th(3 days after the SEC report was filed). They likely waited to report their position and then aggressively raised more capital by shorting VTRS further. This is a play we've seen from Citadel before as they have shorted stocks such as BNGO, SNDL and MVIS to create more capital for their short plays in GME and AMC(IMO).**


. **COMPLETELY NEW 600k share put position in AMC. Citadel is also short AMC. Seeing this position materialize between Q4 2020 - Q1 2021 supports the thesis that Citadel has an influence over the strategy Melvin is undertaking.**


**. COMPLETELY NEW 490K share position in FaceBook (Again Citadel and Point72 are long on FB)**


. **AEO position decreased by 3 Million shares**


. **AMZN position decreased by 84k shares (remember AMZN is a thousand dollar stock, 84k shares is a lot of capital)**


**I also noticed certain positions were gone entirely on the Q1 SEC report**


. **190K share position in Domino's**


. **1.3M share position in McDonalds**


**. 3.5M share position in Hyatt Hotels**


**. 1.5M share position in Live Nation**


. **700k share position in Paypal**


I feel these changes support the thesis that **Melvin Capital has changed their investment strategy due to new majority ownership.**


Remember the squeeze will most likely default multiple lenders, bankrupt a lot of financial institutions and may be the catalyst for a monumental financial crisis (that would have happened soon anyway I mean seriously, I can't believe people think this shit is sustainable). The Hedge Funds on the short side will do anything they can to avoid losing everything by any means necessary.


I encourage criticism of this thesis. I encourage you to prove this thesis wrong. Go through the Quarterly SEC filings. read the source material. Comparing perspectives and scrutinizing research is the best way for accurate information to prevail (which should always be the goal).


I will say though, the skeptic in me wonders if Citadel abused their MM privilege to facilitate short sales for other funds without locating borrows and realized they are ultimately fucked when they have to margin call those shorts. Would explain the RH buy stoppage as well, since Citadel owns RH order flow and therefore would own any naked shorts they sold to RH users as legitimate stock. This might not be the case but it's obvious that Citadel cannot afford Melvin to be margin called. That much is clear.


**TLDR:**


**Citadel and Point72 purchased over 51% of Melvin Capital's share equity after Melvin's broker realized they couldn't close their positions and complete margin call without risking bankruptcy. Since January, Citadel and Point72 collectively possess controlling interest in the company's direction and strategy. Melvin's most recent balance sheet on Fintel lists $22B in AUM, as of 01/31/2021 Melvin had $8B in AUM meaning that Melvin lost at minimum $15B in January. Now where else could Melvin get the type of capital support to keep this charade going (after reports of 49% Q1 losses) if not from the the other funds who stand to lose literally everything if Melvin is margin called on their short positions (be they naked or not).**

Edit 2: Corrected erroneous maths (remember guys I can't read)


Edit 3: Holy shit! Just woke up and saw this post is close to 5k upvotes and heaps of awards!! Thank you for reading and sharing! Definitely looking forward to my next DD 👀.
