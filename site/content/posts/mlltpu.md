---Hi fellow apes 🦍🦍🦍and welcome to Superstonk!


With these volumes, It looks like everyone took a nap today! Let's take a look at the historical volumes and any relations we can see with share price changes.


---------- **BOILERPLATE:**


I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀


**TLDR: Today was the lowest volume trading day since Tuesday January 12 (when the price $19.95)! Historically we have seen huge volume trading days (and big price gains) on the Wednesday and guess what tomorrow is???💎✋🚀🚀🚀**


**NOTE: I am not suggesting that it will moon tomorrow, just that we could see a good spike in volume and price.**


---------


Below is the data for GME from Jan 4 to April 6:

I bolded the days with significantly low volume before we then saw huge volume days.


The first was **Tuesday Jan 12** with only 7m vol. On **Wednesday**, we saw 144m vol and 57% increase in price


The second time was **Tuesday Feb 23** with only 7.5m vol. On **Wednesday** we saw 83m vol and 104% price increase


Today, **Tuesday April 6** we saw 6m in vol. **What will we see tomorrow???**


Also interesting to note, it was **27 trading days between the first two low volume days**, and **28 days between the second and today,** this almost sounds like **a trend....**


**---------- Available Shares to borrow**


Another interesting note, today we saw a **huge increase in the availability of shares to borrow** (from 80k to 950k) through [iborrowdesk.com](https://iborrowdesk.com) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210406192420/https://iborrowdesk.com/).


You can also see that a sharp **increase in the number of shares available to borrow** also happened on **Feb 23rd**, increasing by **900,000 in 1 day**... **how many did it go up by today?**


​


**---------- TLDR**


**TLDR: Today was the lowest volume trading day since Tuesday January 12 (when the price $19.95)! Historically we have seen huge volume trading days (and big price gains) on the next day (Wednesday) after a low volume Tuesday. What will tomorrow bring???💎✋🚀🚀🚀**


**NOTE: I am not suggesting that it will moon tomorrow, just that we could see a good spike in volume and price.**
