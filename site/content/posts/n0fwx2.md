AMD posted their earnings results yesterday after close.


EPS 52 vs EPS 44 (estimated). Meaning that they did almost 20% above expectations! Yet, the stock price dropped hard and is still dropping.

Who has 798300 calls and 560100 puts on MVIS? Citadel.


What did MVIS do in the past couple of days? Pumped from 10$ to 31$ and then dumped to 21$ this morning.

Let's see what else these guys have...

what did Tesla do this week?

Tesla over the last 30 days went from 600 to 745 and in the last 5 days it started dropping.


And all of that despite the news that their had a fantastic quarter and also that they managed to profit with over 100M+ in their BTC sale.
