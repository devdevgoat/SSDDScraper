Intro:
======


This post will give a *relatively* simplistic breakdown of the current situation and landscape of GameStop Stock, or GME (its name on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE), and to summarize the theory that it will soon reach astronomical levels during a market event known as a Short Squeeze. For specifically, this theory is the **MOASS (Mother of All Short Squeezes) Thesis.**


The core intention of the post is to summarize the MOASS Thesis for investors who are not fully up to speed on it, as well as those who are newer to the stock market in general, and are interested in investing. That being said, this writeup is NOT intended to serve as a source of proof/evidence behind this theory, and it operates under the assumption that the theory is valid and that the conditions it is built on are met. For those who intend to dig further into the evidence supporting the theory, there is a massive amount of research and due diligence that has been performed and documented around this theory that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/mnss65/the_apes_guide_to_the_galaxy_a_compilation_of_dds/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525120255/https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/mnss65/the_apes_guide_to_the_galaxy_a_compilation_of_dds/), though it is recommended to use this post to get a basic understanding before digging into the Due Diligence.


Important terms to know before getting into the “Explanation”
=============================================================


These terms are key to understanding the theory and speculated value of a GME investment. Hyperlinks to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210526055809/https://www.investopedia.com/), "the world's leading source of financial content on the web", have been included for most market terms and concepts, and it is recommended to check them out if they are not clear. We will be breaking down some of the more complex terms and concepts within the post and framing them within the context of GME.


Long Position / Buying/Selling Stock
------------------------------------


* When an investor buys a stock, they are considered [long](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210604003402/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) on it
* In other words, holders of long positions have a **positive** number of shares
* To [close](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closeposition.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607040713/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closeposition.asp) a long position the owner would sell their shares on the stock market


The basic idea behind obtaining long position is:


1. Buy the stock
2. Hold it until the price of it increases to a desired amount
3. Sell it for a profit


When people think about buying and selling stock, they are generally talking about [opening](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-position.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607070551/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-position.asp) and [closing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closeposition.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607040713/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closeposition.asp) long positions


Short Position / Shorting/Covering Stock
----------------------------------------


* When a short seller shorts a stock, they hold a [short position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210603013812/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) on the stock, which is essentially the polar opposite of a long positions (kinda)
* Investors with short positions effectively are *in debt* or *owe* the number of shares that they have shorted, and can be considered ***negative*** on the stock
* Eventually, to [close](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closeposition.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607040713/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closeposition.asp) that position, short-sellers must buy a number of shares equal to the size of their short position (buying to close a short position is known as [covering](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortcovering.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607040755/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortcovering.asp))
* Short positions must be reported to regulators (unlike naked short sales)


The basic idea of obtaining a short position on a stock is:


1. Borrow a share owned by a lender
2. Sell the stock that was borrowed
3. Gaining the cash based on the price it was at the time it was “shorted”
4. Pay interest as a percentage of the stock's value
	1. since this is a percentage, the cost of interest increases if the stock's value increases
5. Hold the position until the price has dropped to a desired price
6. Buy the stock on the open market
7. Ideally the stock is bought back at a lower price than originally borrowed for so the investor can pocket the difference
8. Return the share back to the lender


The Float
---------


[The Float](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607040817/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp), or [Floating Stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607040817/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp) is the number of shares of stock that are available to be publicly traded (the number of [Outstanding shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210603225751/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp) minus the amount of [Restricted shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restrictedstock.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607040950/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restrictedstock.asp) that are owned by insiders).


* In theory, the number of shares owned by [retail investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210517224820/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp) and [institutional investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607041225/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp) cannot exceed the float
* SPOILER: GME is believed to have ownership amounting to 200% to 400% of the float if not more due to a something called [naked shorting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210604051509/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp), which is a key part of the thesis, but more on that later
* GME’s float total is currently \~[56.89 Million](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210530232818/https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/) shares
* It is important to note that institutional investors own \~25M-30M of the floating stock
	+ If institutions were to hold during MOASS (not a guarantee, though many are expected to), then the amount of shares publicly would be somewhere around \~25M-30M, meaning there would be even less supply when the short sellers finally have to cover


Retail Investors
----------------


* [Retail Investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210517224820/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp), also known as individual investors are your average investors (not a company or organization)


Institutional Investors
-----------------------


* [Institutional Investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607041225/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp) are organizations that invest on individuals' behalf
* Examples of Institutional Investors
* Endowment Funds
* Commercial Banks
* Mutual Funds
* Hedge funds
* Pension funds
* Insurance companies


Market Makers
-------------



> 
> I'd encourage you to read the Investopedia entry for them for more clarity
> 
> 
> 


* [Market Makers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210517113829/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp) are very different from "Investors" and are a bit harder to explain, but basically are there to increase [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607041335/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) in the market
* When you buy and sell stock, those trades are often going between you and a market maker
* Market makers get "special rules" that enable them to keep liquidity in the market when there is low liquidity
* Naked shorting is one of the options Market Makers have when navigating a trade that other investors do not have


Naked Shorting
--------------


* Naked shorting effectively allows a Market Maker to short a stock without having a borrowed share like normal short selling
* The result is similar to a short sale,
* Naked short sales do NOT have to be reported the same way as normal "Short Sales" and can be "hidden"
* GME is expected to be shorted around two to four times the float, despite the fact that [Short Interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607041404/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp) only accounts for \~20% of the float, meaning most of the shares are shorted via naked shorting
* This type of trade illegal outside of specific situations involving Market Makers
* Due to a loophole and lack of oversight by regulation, Naked short selling can be used to manipulate the price of certain stocks
* Naked shorting was targeted for tighter regulation during the financial crisis of 2008, but enforcement has unfortunately not been effective in preventing it from manipulating the market


Synthetic Shares
----------------


* [Synthetic Shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/synthetic.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607041422/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/synthetic.asp) are the financial instruments that get produced by Naked Short sales
* Often referred to as "Counterfeit" shares (though they may be called this, they are just as legitimate as a non-synthetic share)
* Synthetic shares entitle the owner to all of the same rights as an investor owning a non-synthetic share
* Cases where there is an excessive amount of synthetic shares point to the possibility that a stock is being abused or manipulated


Margin
------


* [Margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607041508/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp) is basically credit that that an investor can use to buy more stock
* When you buy on margin, you must stake the assets you have already purchased with your own cash as collateral
* The amount of Margin you can have depends on the value of your collateral
* The value of your collateral and cash but meet the margin requirements in order to continue to buy on margin
* Keep in mind, the value of your collateral can change if the price goes up or down, and if the value of your collateral/cash drops below the margin requirement, you will received a [Margin Call](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210519211049/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp)


Another way to think about it (better example in the Margin Call heading below this one):


1. Imagine I have $1,000 in stock
2. You obtain a personal loan for another $1000
3. To get the credit, you stake your $1000 in stock (if you default, it goes to the lender to cover your debt)
4. You buy $1000 more stock with that loan (you now own $2000 in stocks, half in cash, half on margin)
5. You will pay interest on the $1000 on margin, but if your investment makes more money than the interest, then you are still profiting
6. If your investment turns bad (lets say the price of your stock falls 50% and you are left with $1000), your lender can forcibly close out your positions (everything you bought in cash and staked as collateral along with what you bought on margin so that they can get the $1000 they loaned you back)


Margin Call
-----------


* A [Margin Call](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210519211049/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) is a notice indicating you have a specific amount of time to deposit enough of your own funds to meet your margin requirement (if you cannot meet the requirement, the lender is entitled to sell all of your holdings to recover what you borrowed


**Examples:**



> 
> This is a slightly complicated scenario that can be a little hard to follow. Give it a few reads if it doesn't make sense the first time, but basically, Margin is a credit line that you can use to buy more assets (effectively a loan backed by collateral and cash in your own account). If you buy assets with it, you have to pay back what you borrowed, whether the value of your investment goes up or down (if the investment goes up in value, you make more than you normally would, but if the investment goes down in value, you lose more than you otherwise would have without margin). 
> 
> 
> This gets even more (or less maybe) complicated when you have short positions AND long positions, like most institutional investors. To have short positions, I still need to have margin, but I do not need to use it to buy stocks, It can act as a buffer if I have a short position on a stock that is increasing in value (with a short position, if the price of something I short goes up, I am losing money), and if it gets too high, it can run against my margin line, causing a margin call.

**Positive Margin Example (Long Positions only):**


1. Imagine I have $1000 in stock X (let's say 10 shares worth $100 each)
2. My broker may lend me margin credit line equal to the value of my assets (so $1000 in margin), and let's say they give me a margin requirement of $800, meaning that the value of my non-margin assets (the ones I bought with my money) must be above $800 in order to keep using margin (so as long as stock X stays above $80 a share, then I will not get a margin call for being below the requirement)
3. I then choose to use the margin, buying 10 more shares of stock X for $100 each, so I now have 20 shares of stock X, valued at 100$ a piece
4. If the price of stock X goes up to %25 per share, and I sell all 20 shares, I just profited $500 (+$25 on 20 shares)
5. In this case, closing the position clears me from the margin debt, as I am no longer using it in an open position
6. If I had not used margin, I would have only walked away with $250 in profit ($25 per share on 10 shares), but instead I made $500, and paid back the credit, plus a little bit of interest.
7. Yay.


**Negative Margin Example (Long Positions Only):**


1. Imagine I have $1000 in stock X (let's say 10 shares worth $100 each)
2. My broker may lend me margin credit line equal to the value of my assets (so $1000 in margin), and let's say they give me a margin requirement of $800, meaning that the value of my non-margin assets (the ones I bought with my money) must be above $800 in order to keep using margin (so as long as stock X stays above $80 a share, then I will not get a margin call for being below the requirement)
3. I then choose to use the margin, buying 10 more shares of stock X for $100 each, so I now have 20 shares of stock X, valued at 100$ a piece
4. If the price of stock X goes down %25, bringing the value per share down to $75 a share, the value of my total position is now $1500, and the value of my non-margin assets is $750, which is below the margin requirement (keep in mind, I borrowed $1000, so that is still the mount I have to pay back)
5. My lender will give me a margin call, indicating I have two business days to deposit 50$ into my account in order to meet the margin requirement
6. If I have the cash to deposit the extra $50 would take my assets to $800 ($750 in stock X + 50$ cash)
	1. If the price of stock X recovered to above $80 per share, it could also satisfy the requirement
7. If I do not have the cash to deposit, then I am in trouble, as after two days, they are allowed to liquidate (sell) the assets I bought with my own money, as well as the assets I bought on margin
	1. Let's say this happens, all my borrowed assets are sold first to cover my $1000 loan (since the price of stock X was only $750, it only covers $750 of my $1000 margin line
	2. I now have $750 left in assets of Stock X, but I still owe money from margin, so my lender is entitled to sell $250 work of my shares in order to get their full $1000 back
	3. I am now left with $500 total ($750 in 10 shares of stock X - $250)
8. Not Yay.


**Negative Margin Example (Long Positions and Short Positions):**


**THIS IS THE RELEVANT ONE TO GME**


1. Imagine I have $1000 in stock X (let's say 10 shares worth $100 each)
2. My broker may lend me margin credit line equal to the value of my assets (so $1000 in margin), and let's say they give me a margin requirement of $800, meaning that the value of my non-margin assets (the ones I bought with my money) must be above $800 in order to keep using margin
3. Instead of using the margin to buy more, I instead short 10 shares of stock Y which is at $50 a share currently (giving me $500 in extra cash), which I use to buy 5 more shares of stock X
4. I am now long 15 shares of stock X valued at $1500 and short 10 shares of stock Y valued at -$500 (negative $500) for a net value of $1000
5. No margin is actively committed to open positions, and I am still using my $1000
6. Now, lets say a short squeeze happens involving stock Y, causing the price to skyrocket to $200 per share
7. My short position is now -$2000 (10 shares of -$200 each)
8. My net account value is now $-500 ($1500 - $2000) which is now using my margin, and because my account's value is no longer above $800, I no longer meet margin requirements so I get a margin call
9. If I cannot balance my account, the lender will liquidate my $1500 in stock X in order to pay the -$2000 I owe, leaving me with -$500 left in debt
10. I have now defaulted, as I cannot pay the $500
11. Now that I have defaulted, the lender who gave me margin owns my short positions, meaning they are now short whatever was left
12. The lender can now navigate the short positions however they want (they can hold them and hope the price goes down, and cover to close them, or they can close them immediately, costing them the whole $500 I still owed)


Short Squeeze
=============


* A [Short Squeeze](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525080052/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp) is a market event that occurs when there is a large short position on a stock whose price rapidly increases higher than expected, normally due to a catalyst
* During the short squeeze, the losses of those who have short positions continue to increase higher it goes
* Since they **owe** shares, the cost to cover their position increases depending on how high the price goes (there is theoretically no limit on how high a stock can go)
* As market participants who are short on the stock buy to cover, supply decreases and demand increases, causing the price to increase even more rapidly
* While short sellers are scrambling to cover their positions, the rapid price change may entice investors who are not short on the stock to buy it in order to make a quick profit
* Again, lowering supply and increasing demand


The Mother of All Short Squeezes (MOASS) – Explanation
======================================================


Now that we have gone through the many important terms, we can get to the theory behind MOASS.


Due excessive short-selling and naked shorting of GME by certain market participants (primarily large hedge funds and market makers), retail investors and long institutional investors collectively own a number of shares that exceeds the the float. The amount of shares that are currently owned is theorized to range roughly between **200%-400%** of the float **if not more**, meaning that 100%-300% of the float has a corresponding short position (mostly naked shorts). For context, most stocks generally have around 1% Short Interest, and 10%-20% short interest is considered to be excessive, let alone over 100% of it.


Short sellers must eventually close, or cover their short position, and the only way to do that is to buy the shares owned by the investors who are long (in the meantime Short-sellers are paying interest on that short position until it is closed proportional to the cost of the shares, which bleeds their capital over time). Unfortunately for the short sellers, the owners of the shares **ARE NOT** obligated to sell their shares. The short-sellers, however, **ARE** obligated to buy in order to close their position (or else keep paying interest).


So what happens if no one is selling the shares they are “long” on, but short sellers need to buy them? The answer is “supply and demand”. With very little supply and high demand, the price of a stock can increase far beyond its fundamental value. If short sellers received a margin call due to no longer meeting their margin requirement their assets will be forcibly liquidated by their lender in order to pay back the margin, as well as close out the position if the borrower defaults.


If you are wondering why an organization would abusively short a stock like this if they eventually have to cover their positions, the primary reason is that, if a company goes bankrupt or gets delisted from the stock market (this is believed to have occurred with Toys'R'Us for example), the short sellers DO NOT have to close the position, and all of the proceeds from the short sale effectively disappear from their books, and they do not even have to pay taxes on this profit.


Short positions amount to the total number of long positions minus the float, meaning (based on the theorized range) that somewhere between \~56-170 Million shares will need to be bought in order to close all short positions. It is expected that the members with short positions (hedge funds and market makers who have been naked shorting the stock) will be unable to cover their short positions, resulting in a situation where their lenders, all the way up to the clearinghouse (DTCC) will have to sort out the positions. If the DTCC/NSCC is forced to unwind the positions, it is widely believed that they will rapidly cover short positions at whatever price they are available for (this is how their systems are said to handle a member default), liquidating whatever assets are necessary from the defaulting member.


The condensed explanation:
==========================


1. GME is over-shorted
2. The mainstream media reports that this is not the case, however, research performed by retail investors indicates the opposite
	1. It is important to keep in mind that the organizations who stand to lose the most from a GME squeeze own substantial financial positions in these media outlets (they are incentivized to push the media into pushing the narrative that short positions have covered)
	2. The market drops in stocks and cryptocurrency in May correlate with actions indicative of margin calls
3. GME is not alone in being over-shorted, though it is the most damaging short position among short sellers
4. Short-selling inherently reduces the value of a stock, and if a stock falls to 0 (this destroys the ability to raise capital), that company may go bankrupt, preventing those with short positions from ever having to pay for their short sale
5. GME has steadily been increasing in price, which is causing more losses every day for short sellers
6. As GME price increases, short-seller’s losses increase, causing panic to close their positions or else go bankrupt
7. Short sellers must buy shares from holders who are not obligated or willing to sell creating a crisis of supply and demand
8. Very low supply and very high demand causes the price to skyrocket
9. There is theoretically no limit on how high a stock’s price can go
10. If short sellers are unable to meet the requirements necessary during a margin call, they default, forcing their lender to be obligated to pay the leftover debt
11. If the lender defaults, ownership of the chain goes up to the [DTCC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dtcc.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607071523/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dtcc.asp) (more specifically, the NSCC who is a subsidiary of DTCC who handles securities like stocks)


Final thoughts...
=================


This is the GME MOASS thesis. GME is a stock that stands to hit an unprecedented price point due to the fact that manipulators of the market have failed to bankrupt GameStop thanks in huge part to [Ryan Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210519063737/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen) and all of the GME investors who took part in this saga. It may not be today, this week, or even this month, but one day soon, these toxic participants have no choice but to buy the stock. In some schools of thought, it is though that these participants over-estimated how "reasonable" retail investors can be. In truth, they didn't understand the demographic they were fighting with. Gamers are some of the most stubborn people on the planet. These are individuals who will sink tens of thousands of hours into the same video game because "they just like it". Well, "we like the stock", and to us, the adversaries on Wall Street just are just another "boss". We may have needed to retry a couple times, but we always win eventually.


At this point, if you are reading this, it is up to you to decide your next move, whether that is to do some due diligence of your own, walk away, or say screw it and buy a couple shares just in case we are right. Many apes have set their floor (minimum amount of acceptable gains) at $20,000,000. We don't care if anyone else buys or not, because we know the outcome is inevitable. Time is running out for the toxic market participants involved, and even the news can't hide that we are on the brink of a massive market event that will ripple through the entire global financial system, and we will probably never see an event like this again in our lifetime.


...And some history -
=====================

It would be a disservice to this entire community to have a history section that did not mention a man named Keith Gill, also known as u/DeepFuckingValue on reddit and TheRoaringKitty on twitter. If you don't know who I am talking about, look him up, as I feel like I stand no chance of doing him justice here. All I will say that this was a man who became nothing short of a legend, setting the bar for Diamond Hands, and without him, GME would not be here as it is today.


Back in mid-to-late 2020, the online community on reddit r/wallstreetbets discovered how over-shorted the GME stock was, and by December, it was widely believed that a massive short squeeze was about to take place. As December 2020 turned into January 2021, members of this community were buying everything they could, with many starting while the share price was in the single-digits. As the share price began to rapidly increase in January, reaching detrimentally impacting levels for abusive short sellers, the first squeeze of the GME Saga took place, with millions of individuals jumping in, causing the stock price to peak at nearly $500 per share. Unfortunately, the squeeze was cut short due to many popular brokers, such as Robin Hood and Interactive Brokers shutting down the ability to buy GME, only allowing clients to sell and in many cases, closing out their clients' positions without their consent to protect themselves and the prime brokers they answer to. After buyers were no longer able to purchase, the price fell back down to 40$ before stabilizing, costing these abusive hedge funds Billions in USD.


Despite the drop back to 40$, there were many indicators pointing to the possibility that the vast majority of shares that were bought prior to the January squeeze had not been sold, supporting the possibility that there was still a massive short position on GME, but many gave up, losing massive amounts of money in this gamble. Having nothing but hope or simply just pure unwillingness to sell, even as many retail buyers had given up on GME, a still-significant number of holders held, many of whom had bought in at $100, $200, $300, even $400 per share and had seen their portfolios fall by 50%-90% or even more. These investors held, demonstrated what is referred to in the community as **Diamond Hands**, and seemingly out of nowhere, on 2/24/21, the price quadrupled from \~$40 to $169.56 by the next days open. It was that day that hope across all current and former GME investors was renewed, and they were certain the GME saga was not over. Other reddit communities, most notably r/SuperStonk, picked up where r/wallstreetbets left off, continuing to research every angle of GME, charming professionals and authorities in the in the financial world and gaining their input, knowledge, and support. This community of investors has been learning more about the market than many others have learned and perhaps *will* learn in their entire lives "investing".


During this time of learning, it has became certain to these investors that the market was always rigged against them, and is rampant with Market Makers and Hedge Funds on Wall Street who found ways to abuse the system and take advantage of limited regulatory oversight for their own gain at the expense of great companies and retail investors alike.


Unfortunately for those groups on Wall Street, this these retail investors know time is running out, and it is impossible for them to escape their short positions. Another notable fact is that, to many of these individuals investing in GME, it isn't about the money. Thanks to the highly intelligent members of this community, who prefer to go by "APEs", but are otherwise known as "dumb money" on Wall Street, this community knows exactly what parties are toxifying the market and who stands to lose the most by sitting on the other side of the MOASS.


Many of us will be holding with Diamond Hands until every toxic market participant has gone bankrupt. It costs us nothing to hold long positions, and we have no intention of selling until we see a number that is big, and we don't mean a number that is big to "us" we mean a number that is big to "them".


Looking for brokers that won't be like RobbingHood and screw you over during MOASS?

TL;DR: This is a fight Wall Street is not going to win. Chances are this will truly be "THE MOASS", meaning there will never be another like it in our lifetime (or ever). While the conditions in play (the ability for big money to brutally manipulate the market) enabled what may end up being the greatest transfer of wealth in history, actual reformation to prevent a landscape like this from forming again is probably best long term (I say this as a pragmatist, and am honestly very far from an idealist). If you want to influence reform, Buy, Hold, Vote. If you are just here for the tendies, Buy, Hold, Vote.


Notes:


I truly didn't expect this level of reception on the post. Fun fact, this post was at least 51% because of [this chain of events](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nhv856/dear_shfsfxstreet_in_response_to_literally/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210525141328/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nhv856/dear_shfsfxstreet_in_response_to_literally/). You just had to call out our Diamond Hands.


Edit: interestingly enough, this post seemed to have gotten a pretty good amount of exposure outside of r/Superstonk. Thought it was being shilled, but they were just comments from the unenlightened. Quite an outcome. Definitely will be reposting an even more refined version.


Final version will be posted the morning of 5/26
