==========


I am not a financial advisor, and I do not provide financial advice! Everything within this post is my opinion and observations. They should be taken with skepticism. So grab a crayon my friends! June has started off absolutely wild!


TL;DR: Hedgies are close to meeting [their doom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw_cdqQHGA8) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210607064231/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw_cdqQHGA8). DOOOM.

**Actual TL;DR: June 1st has kicked off with the DTC, ICC, OCC auction and wind-down plans officially being in place. This means it is OK to launch the rocket because those three entities are now protected. We're seeing very similar price movements and gamma squeeze signals compared to the previous T+35/T+21 runup that occurred from February 24th to March 10th. This means that we could very well see another gamma squeeze of similar or greater magnitude which would begin to go parabolic around June 9th.**


**Note: This does NOT mean that a gamma squeeze WILL be coming. This is data supporting the fact that it COULD be coming. Do not take this as financial advice, and be aware that if you day trade you could miss the rocket.**


1. June Kicked Off A Few Things
===============================


Here's a list of things you might have missed (save for OCC-003) that are now in place as of **June 1st**. Which further supports that the MOASS is getting close!


â€‹


* JP Morgan opened [MORE netting accounts](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/5/25/MBS987-21.pdf) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210526041044/https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/5/25/MBS987-21.pdf).
* These are piggy banks for sucking up assets of defaulting members in the auctions of the DTC, ICC, and OCC. I wonder who JP Morgan is going to consume?


â€‹


* DTC, ICC, and OCC wind-down and auction plans now all in place.
* [OCC-003](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/occ/2021/34-92038.pdf) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210527223252/https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/occ/2021/34-92038.pdf) was the final one to join. Welcome, OCC! All three entities are finally ready for the bomb.
* I**n my opinion this means that the rocket is ready for takeoff because these entities are now protected.**


â€‹


* ICC [index swaption](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dowjonescdx.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210602025243/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dowjonescdx.asp) discounts started through [ICC-014](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/icc/2021/34-91922.pdf) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210518181548/https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/icc/2021/34-91922.pdf).
* Think of this as an index like SPY/QQQ/VIX/etc. that watches for the potential defaults of others in the financial world.
* The base swaptions are just like options, they give you the right but not the obligation to buy (or sell) insurance. But, this rule is for the **INDEX** discounts - meaning it is a bundle of these swaptions among a bunch of entities.
* The ICC must be preparing for members of the index to be going on the brink of defaulting, or defaulting. From my interpretation, these discounts give others a cheaper hedge against defaults, and potentially get to scrape by instead of going under. This won't save the guys who are in too deep, it just helps everyone else to remain afloat after this market bomb goes off.


â€‹


* ["Trading halt" rule amendments](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/no2ogw/two_approved_amendments_to_trading_halts_as_of_528/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210603082831/https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/no2ogw/two_approved_amendments_to_trading_halts_as_of_528/) were passed May 28th, and are therefore in effect as of June 1st.
* The wording of these amendments are VERY interesting. And the timing is VERY interesting. Take a look.
* They will allow halts "**In the event of a series of quotes, orders, or transactions at prices substantially unrelated to the current market for the security or securities"**
	+ E.g. They are preparing for people to be placing sell orders on securities/stocks that are **WAY** far away from the current trading price. Sound familiar? Like if GME is trading at $260 and a sell order comes in for $100k, $500k, $1m, $10m, etc? Yeah. **Very curious** why they'd push this amendment out.
	+ **Edit: This is most likely to have a slow burn upward in price on the standard +/-10% within 5 minutes trading halt. Don't worry about what has yet to happen. Only time will tell how this plays out!**

2. Similarities To The Previous T+21 T+35 Runup
===============================================


It's quite amazing to look at everything right now and see the similarities. We already know that the T+21 loop is confirmed. It's like poetry. GME hits a beat in a cyclical manner every 21 trading days, and it is evidence that shorters are stuck in an endless dance. [Can we really look at T+21 and think that "they have covered their short positions"...?]


If we can see patterns emerge from T+21, we can most likely see patterns emerge from T+21 and T+35. And so far, the current T+21/T+35 looks shockingly similar to the previous T+21/T+35.


One similarity is the resurgence of gamma squeeze signals.


The amazing ape /u/yelyah2, and I'm sure many others, have been [identifying signs that a gamma squeeze could be coming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlrtul/gamma_squeeze_could_be_coming_soon/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210603082909/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlrtul/gamma_squeeze_could_be_coming_soon/):


![](/img/q69cchm7kq271.png)


The most important data point to keep an eye on here is the yellow that spikes up/down. This is the "**Gamma Neutral**" value.



> 
> The **gamma neutral price** is the underlying price that creates a **total market gamma of 0 across all GME options** **(all expiration dates)**. It is often associated with high volatility, and sometimes (especially in GME's case), it's associated with gamma squeezes. - /u/yelyah2
> 
> 
> 


In other words, if you see Gamma Neutral spike up to the thousands and GME is currently trading in the hundreds, that means a Gamma Squeeze **could be** coming. Because the price needs to shift up to that amount in order to return gamma to 0 for a low-risk hedge. I'd definitely recommend reading their work on their findings!


You'll see that in the first purple circle of Figure 1, Gamma Neutral spikes up on **February 24th**. Gamma Neutral then slams back down a few days later because the pressure was killed off. About a week later, March 5th, Gamma Neutral spikes again and remains high until the flash-crash of March 10th. Up until the flash crash, GME went on an absolute run in price and was starting to go parabolic.


Take a look at the second purple circle of Figure 1. The same spike up/down over the course of a few days occurred again starting **May 25th**. Oddly similar to **February 24th**'s spike up/down, right? Both brief anomalies initiated on T+21 dates.


Between March 10th and May 25th, **Gamma Neutral hasn't spiked up at all,** despite there being two additional T+21 cycles between:


* March 25th (T+21)
* April 26th (T+21)


Huh. What could have changed this time on May 25th?


[Enter T+21 and T+35](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nf22qz/theory_on_the_ftd_loop_missing_link_a_t35_surge/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210518184403/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nf22qz/theory_on_the_ftd_loop_missing_link_a_t35_surge/). The mechanics aren't fully fleshed out for why T+35 happens, I mean it's all based on patterns we see, but T+35 most likely applies to [Net Capital](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n4h832/major_deep_itm_call_option_dates_a_massive_net/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210522081619/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n4h832/major_deep_itm_call_option_dates_a_massive_net/). Net Capital being that the shorters must adjust their short position debts after a timeframe of their debts being discovered, or risk going net negative. This must be done in order to not default, because going net negative would trigger a margin call.


These T+35's initiate from three major option dates:


1. January 15th, 2021 (--> February 24th)
2. April 16th, 2021 (--> May 24th)
3. July 16th, 2021 (--> August 23rd)


So, we're not looking at purely T+21 days, but a [wombo-combo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD_imYhNoQ4) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210602073840/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD_imYhNoQ4) of T+35 and T+21 which could very well be the reason gamma squeeze signals are flashing again. **Per my theory, a T+35/T+21 occurred last week, May 25th, due to April 16th options expirations. And the previous T+35/T+21 occurred on February 24th.**


COOL. So it appears that T+21/T+35 cycles can cause gamma squeezes due to the extra pressure on the shorters, and that might be why we're seeing a resurgence of the Gamma Neutral squeeze indicator this cycle. Oof, not a lot of data points, but hey. **I like the patterns**. ðŸ‘€


Moving forward, let's take a look at the price movements over the past few days. Of note:


* The purple call-out boxes are pointing to T+21/T+35 cycles (Feb 24, May 25).
* The red call-out boxes are pointing to purely T+21 cycles (March 25, April 26).


![](/img/jfeq0m27vq271.png)


Starting back at February 24th, all the way to the left of Figure 2, you'll see the purple callout box pointing to a purple box around the actual prices of GME. The lower bound of the box starts at the close price of February 24th, and the upper bound of the box ends at the close price of March 2nd, which is 4 trading days later. I used 4 trading days because, well, that's how many days we have seen since May 25th so far. I've applied this same method to all other T+21 dates and plotted their respective boxes. This is a visual to show you the behavior of the price following T+21 and T+21/T+35 cycles, and the differences between the two.


You'll notice how on the T+21 days between February 24th and May 25th (**red callouts**), that the price was anchored around the same closing price of T+21 and not much upward pressure was applied. Meanwhile, the T+21/T+35 cycles (**purple callouts**) have had breakaways from these prices and are gaining much more momentum. The prices following T+21/T+35 have more support and are doing that beautiful bull-flag pattern that TA apes love. Further supporting that we're in a potential runup to a gamma squeeze in the near future.


[Can't stop. Won't stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210608035827/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM). GameStop.


The similarities of the price movement so far are quite hype, because this is **on top of the resurgence of the gamma squeeze indicators**.


With all of the DTC, ICC, and OCC auction and wind-down plans being in effect as well as the other items I identified in Section 1.... man. It seems too good to be true right now.


For fun, I plotted in blue ("10 bars, Nd") the gamma ramp timeframes in Figure 2. Check out when the next parabolic move like March 10th could occur. **June, frickin' 9th**. Sound familiar? Shareholder meeting? It's probably just coincidence, but damn. Good timing. Also haha 6/9. Nice.


Further possible support is this post by the amazing ape /u/isnisse. They have identified that a [breakout could be coming on June 10th](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/np3cyg/the_tables_will_turn/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210602160307/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/np3cyg/the_tables_will_turn/). They've used a really clever approach to guesstimate the breakout. Definitely take a look! Confirmation bias overloaded once I saw this.


One last thing to note before moving on is **the number of consecutive green close days that have followed May 25th**. We have not seen that before, where there's a ton of support following T+21 or T+21/T+35, even back for the February 24th cycle.


Are shorties losing their grip? One metric I was watching for the longest time was Deep ITM CALL purchases, which could also signal that their DOOOM is near.


3. The Death of Deep ITM CALLs?
===============================


In my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nc1lny/ive_estimated_the_current_si_based_on_the_si/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210601144234/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nc1lny/ive_estimated_the_current_si_based_on_the_si/), I was thinking that these Deep ITM CALLs were being used to satisfy FTDs. Now I'm not entirely sure - it could be used for that purpose, certainly. But it could simply be that they were used to delay the FTDs rather than satisfying them as people were predicting for the longest time. If that is the case, then the shorties are most likely losing their grip, as shown by the increase of volumes in meme stocks across the board. The  is about to hit the fan.


I'm grabbing this figure from /u/broccaaa's post [The Naked Shorting Scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvdgf5/the_naked_shorting_scam_in_numbers_ai_detection/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210602234023/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvdgf5/the_naked_shorting_scam_in_numbers_ai_detection/) which compares Deep ITM CALL Volumes to FTDs:


![](/img/c490umhwqq271.png)


When FTDs skyrocket, Deep ITM CALLs are eaten up. You see this occur extensively in January due to the mini-squeeze that occurred from massive FOMO of retail around the world. And then a resurgence of these Deep ITM CALL anomalies in the February 24th to March 10th runup due to more FTDs appearing.


Ever since March 10th, these Deep ITM CALL purchases have slowly decayed and died off. User /u/Dan\_Bren had been posting about these anomalies for weeks, and weeks, until suddenly - the anomalies stopped. The only significant purchases that have been made since the Deep ITM CALLs died off have been for Deep OTM CALLs and Deep ITM PUTs.


* [Deep OTM CALLs were purchased](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nafcuh/a_couple_deep_itm_puts_and_lots_of_otm_calls_were/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210603093922/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nafcuh/a_couple_deep_itm_puts_and_lots_of_otm_calls_were/). Possibly a big entity expecting the price to pop by July 16th.
* Deep ITM PUTs were purchased as well (same link). [We got a warning that they could be used to flash crash the price on May 28th](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmxze3/flash_crash_warning_4000_618_300_puts_bought_last/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210601122034/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmxze3/flash_crash_warning_4000_618_300_puts_bought_last/), and sure enough, it happened.


So what does this mean? The give-up on Deep ITM CALLs could be many things.


Perhaps there's no more liquidity to use them?


Maybe they came up with a better way to delay FTDs?


It could be too expensive and they can't delay FTDs any more?


Maybe, by some weird reason, DTC-005 is actually in effect and blocking this practice - which makes the FTDs come to fruition these next few weeks?


The resurgence in meme stocks across the board makes it look like they're losing their grip and its simply too expensive for them to delay it any more. The volume, in my eyes, is not shorts covering but the volume is due to the FTDs beginning to pour out into the world.


The peddling of AMC could be that is their last and only option. To divide and conquer. Their best chance now is to try to pull GME apes into AMC because, despite it being shorted heavily as well, it is a much higher float and lower price. Therefore it would be easier to contain and take control of. They have to try to push AMC because all their other efforts failed. That being said, when GME goes off, AMC, KOSS, and other meme stocks will most likely squeeze as well. But - GME is the backbone, and only as long as GME remains strong will every stock experience a squeeze.


The latest T+21/T+35 cycle is prepping a gamma squeeze, just like what we saw from February 24th to March 10th. It's surprising how similar things are looking so far, especially in the price movement and support staying in the $260s as of after hours of June 1st.


It's even scarier that the gamma squeeze, if it happens, would start to go parabolic exactly on June 9th.
