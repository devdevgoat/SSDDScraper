630 million share data confirmed by TD.


There is a tonne of great DD in this post. read it, then read it again, then understand it after reading it again.


PRO tip: on android device long hold over text, select all, select 3 dots on right, select "read aloud"


This helps me digest those extra long DDs


*marked at possible DD to bring attention to the real DD linked*


EDIT: I DON'T WANT YOUR UPVOTES, I DON'T WANT YOUR AWARDS. I WANT YOU TO READ THE ATTACHED POST


I couldn't care less about Karma, even less about fake awards. I am not HODLing GME for Krama! 


NOTE: The OP doesn't say he called TD in the post, he says it in the comments do a search for "Yea that's why I posted the screenshots (also called TD to confirm so yea their legit)" you will see it.


I'm just tryin to bring attention to the OP, not to me FFS
