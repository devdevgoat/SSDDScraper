​


TL:DR
=====


**Another Chart Indicator flipped from bearish to bullish! This means that we COULD see another rally! KEEP HOLDING AND ENJOY YOUR WEEKEND! In the end (there will never be an end to GME 🚀🚀🚀) everything will be allright!**


**SPOILER: Please don't mistake the techincal term "squeeze" with the "short squeeze" that might happen to GME. Even though one could lead to another it is not codependant! What I'm describing here is a momentum indicator used for techical analysis, showing that something is happening. All I want to do is to give back to the community and to provide some good vibes for the weekend!**

1. INTRODUCTION
===============


Okay guys, first, don't get too crazy about that! An indicator is just something that SHOWS what a situation IS like - AT THE MOMENT! It is NOT the 8 Ball of truth for the upcoming future. This indicator MIGHT show us at least something interesting.


**Keep in mind that noone - not even the most experienced trader with the best indicators - can EVER predict to a 100% the possible outcome of a chart. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONSIDER ALL DIRECTIONS! This is called the chess dilemma!** We can only ever **react** as far as it makes sense and is meaningful. Maybe u/WardenElite can cover the indicator from a more experienced and more technical view! in the end, TA is more or less stonks astrology. It CAN happen, it doesnt have to!

2. THE SQM SQUEEZE MOMENTUM INDICATOR BY LAZYBEAR
=================================================


Stock price is going down, why are you saying SQM is bullish? The answer is below.



> 
> *The cited parts are the more wrinklier parts of this possible DD and sourced from the below guides. They mainly describe how the SQM (TTM) work.*
> 
> 
> 


**2.1. What am I talking about?**


The Squeeze Momentum Indicator (SQM by LazyBear) is based upon the TTM Indicator by John Carter and capitalzes on the tendency for price break out strongly after consolidating in a tight trading range.


**2.2. How is the SQM calculated?**


The SQM is a combination of several instruments.


2.2.1. The SQM uses Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels to measure the price compression.



> 
> *If the Bollinger Bands are completely enclosed within the Keltner Channels, that indicates a period of very low volatility. This state is known as the squeeze. When the Bollinger Bands expand and move back outside of the Keltner Channel, the squeeze is said to have “fired”: volatility increases and prices are likely to break out of that tight trading range in one direction or the other. The on/off state of the squeeze is shown with small crosses on the zero line of the indicator: black indicate the squeeze is on, and grey crosses indicate the squeeze is releasing.*
> 
> 
> 


​



> 
> *Once the values for the upper and lower Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels have been calculated, the formula for determining the state of the squeeze is simple. If both of the following conditions are true, then the squeeze is on for that period:* 
> 
> 
> *Upper Bollinger Band < Upper Keltner Channel* 
> 
> 
> *Lower Bollinger Band > Lower Keltner Channel* 
> 
> 
> *If they are not both true (one or both Bollinger Bands fall outside of the Keltner Channel), then the squeeze is off for that period.*
> 
> 
> 


2.2.2. The SQM Squeeze indicator also uses a momentum oscillator to show the expected direction of the move when the squeeze fires.



> 
> *First, calculate the Donchian midline for the specified number of momentum periods (20 is used by default)* 
> 
> 
> *(Highest high in 20 periods + lowest low in 20 periods) / 2*
> 
> 
> 


​



> 
> *Second, calculate the SMA of the close for the specified number of momentum periods (so by default, a 20-period SMA of price).*
> 
> 
> 


​



> 
> *Third, calculate the delta between the close and the average of the Donchian midline and SMA values using the following formula:* 
> 
> 
> *Close - ( (Donchian midline + SMA) / 2 )* 
> 
> 
> *Finally, use linear regression on the delta values to smooth them. The formula for linear regression is beyond the scope of this article, but it essentially looks for the “line of best fit” given the available data. The momentum histogram values show how far above or below the average the price is expected to be.*

Those are the green and red lines at the bottom.

Now Look at the indicator at the bottom. As soon as it switches from bright red to dark red and goes over to bright green, it signals a switch into a bullish pattern. Right now, the bright red switched over to a dark red! That means its heading to bright green!


Citing LazyBears discription of the SQM:



> 
> *Black crosses on the midline show that the market just entered a squeeze. This signifies low volatility, market preparing itself for an explosive move (****up or down****). Gray crosses signify "Squeeze release".*
> 
> 
>

Now it doesnt mean it has to happen exactly like both last times, but confirming my bias, this jacks my titts!!!


Clarification: The chart does not have to move immediately! SQM just INDICATES that there COULD be momentum ramping up to catapult again! It has to switch to grey crosses next!


​


3. WHEN LAMBO?
==============


It correlates with the BIG WEDGE shaping. I guess end of next week, or maybe the week after, we COULD see a flippening to BRIGHT GREEN of the indicator! Some catalysts could help the chart to form... 4/16 ... 4/20.


**THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE SQUEEZE IS HAPPENING AT THAT DATE! IT IS NOT A SET DATE, WE DON'T DO THAT HERE!**


It's just an **estimate for how the indicator could evolve**. An evolving indicator doesnt induce the causality for the chart to take the same step! It's the other way around! The chart feeds the indicators and thereby NO INDICATOR can ever predict a precise date because its just a formula!


For the wrinkliest of our wrinkly apes in here, the thesis somewhere correlates with the Elliott Wave Theory DD posted by u/ChristianRauchenwald. It is a must read! And check out the video links in his post: <https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnezu9/three_possible_ways_how_gme_plays_out_according/> [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210409111954/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnezu9/three_possible_ways_how_gme_plays_out_according/)


​


4. CONCLUSION
=============


**The Squeeze Momentum Indicator has flipped**. **We are officially transcending into a bullish pattern again, compared to the last two races!**


Take it with you for the weekend and prepare for **POTENTIALLY CRAZY WEEKS** to come!! Keep calm as always! Always keep your head up, even if the chart was rather meh today! GME has its backup upside potential from investor's perspective in the long run! No question! RC will transform it to a big player anyways! Fortune will come!


**BUT PLEASE REMEMBER - ANY TECHNICAL ANALYSIS FOR GAMESTOP IS PURE SPECULATION! MARK MY WORDS! THIS IS NOTHING BUT A PURE GUESS!**


​


5. FEEDBACK SECTION
===================


- u/tendieful: there is a v2 of that indicator! I will look that up and update it!


**-** u/Feed\_Bag (best name) is right! The indicator needs volume to be even more precise! Hopefully it will rack up next week!


​


6. UPDATE SECTION
=================


**UPDATE 1 - v2 SQM Indicator**


Regarding the feedback, I've taken a look at v2 of the indicator (which is not updated by LazyBear himself) and factored in the volume (we are still using a momentum indicator). I've also put in the bollinger bands (green) and keltner channels (blue), to visualize the calculation method better. The calculation method seems to be the same. It is just a visual change for a maybe more precise signal.

Changelog:



> 
> Modified version of Squeeze Momentum Indicator including line graph of the main indicator instead of using a Histogram and a second Signal line (5 bars SMA of the original line) to provide visual BUY/SELL signals.
> 
> 
> 


The signals:



> 
> BUY when Blue crosses ABOVE the RED signal line 
> 
> 
> SELL when Blue crosses BELOW the RED signal line
> 
> 
> 


![](/img/jjd7gro0x8s61.png)


Now keep in mind, that buy and sell signals mean entry points for OPTIONS TRADING! But we are HOLDING SHARES! Thereby it indicates to us if the chart MIGHT ascend or trend downwards!


​


**UPDATE 2 - VOLUME IS THE KEY**


The main driver for our chart is VOLUME! As you can see, since the last rally, the volume continued to go down. Nevertheless, the price was relatively steady and stable - low volatility as stated above and as v1 SQM indicates.


![](/img/6z9n36srx8s61.png)


What does it mean in the end?


Taking into consideration, that the price held up so good against the deep itm short drops of the HF, if we get volume, this CAN go crazy! Thinking of the news Melvin losing 49% in the last quarter, should give them a taste of their own methods! They won't be able to push the price down infinitely.


And that's where our hopefully catalysts come into play... we will find out soon!
