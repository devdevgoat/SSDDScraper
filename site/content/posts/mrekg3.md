Bit of a pullback after that last climb.

**Edit 20 2:06PM:**


Aw man I had my popcorn and fries ready. Stock at 161.67 right now. Can the show start :) ?


**Edit 19 2:02PM:**


Significant buy volume >100k. Will it be sustained though?


**Edit 18 2:00PM:**


Big green candle. Show finally starting?


**Edit 17 1:48PM:**


------------>


**Edit 16 1:12PM:**


Volume picking up. Bit of an upside breakout/mean reversion.


**Edit 15 12:25PM:**


Well helloooo there Mr. Wedge. Volume too low as of now for a major breakout. If volume kicks back in, perhaps we can see an upside breakout.

**Edit 14 12:09PM:**


The Call inventory has significantly expanded since yesterday. 3,000 extra calls placed at the 200 strike.

**Edit 13 11:59AM:**


This particular line, resistance of the wedge is now acting as a support line. We could continue inching lower through the day.

**Edit 12 11:48AM:**


Option volume still pretty low. I feel as if most of the action has not yet started. Volume also sitting incredibly low.


**Edit 11 11:32AM:**


Volume dried up, less than 10k a minute.


**Edit 10 10:58AM:**


150 strike Calls were bought.


![](/img/bci67zs1qct61.png)
**Edit 9 10:22AM:**


Majority of those Calls are sold. Either sold to close or short Calls.


**Edit 8 10:20AM:**

**Edit 7 10:15AM:**


152.5 support is next.


**Edit 6 9:51AM:**


We're moving below that channel right now, but we can end up spending a lot of time bouncing in that channel.

**Edit 5 9:45AM:**


Dip ended around 9:45AM.


**Edit 4 9:41AM:**


Typical 9:50AM dip.


**Edit 3 9:38AM:**


Let's wait for 10AM when the action will probably start.


**Edit 2 9:31AM:**


210k volume first minute candle. Pretty low.


**Edit 1 9:25AM:**

Premarket Analysis
==================


Bit of a small skirmish premarket. GME gapped and was immediately shorted down.
