**Edit 16 2:09PM:**


Just verifying that I am indeed still here and not kidnapped by hedgies. Hello everyone! What another boring midday haha!


**Edit 15 12:34PM:**


Bit of a ---------> midday. Hope power hour is a bit more fun!


**Edit 14 11:46AM:**


Increasing Call volume at the 170 strike causing a price bounce.

**Edit 13 11:26AM:**


Finally testing the 163 support I speculated on on stream. Patience my friends. We may not see any explosive power today, but that won't make me any less bullish on this stock.

**Edit 12 10:56AM:**


Volume slowing down, we can bounce within the 165.5 - 169 channel.

**Edit 11 10:45AM:**


Volume hasn't really picked up. Broader market dragging GME down a bit.


**Edit 10 10:35AM:**


If volume picks up, we can continue the ascending channel.

**Edit 9 10:31AM:**


Volume slowing down. We might consolidate around 171.5.


**Edit 8 10:25AM:**


The pickup in volume has resulted in GME favoring the upside. 174 resistance is next.


**Edit 7 10:14AM:**


GME inverted the SPY a bit. That negative beta eh ;)


**Edit 6 10:10AM:**


SPY tanking a bit.

**Edit 5 10:00AM:**


On low volume, we may move down a bit and then consolidate.

**Edit 4 9:46AM:**


Bouncing within the 165.5 - 169 channel.

**Edit 3 9:37AM:**


Slight gap fill, two possible Fib support levels for a bounce.

**Edit 2 9:31AM:**


823k volume 1st minute.


**Edit 1 9:29AM:**


Added 163 support.
