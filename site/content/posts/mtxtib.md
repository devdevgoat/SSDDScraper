If you or your parents have their retirement accounts **PASSIVELY MANAGED BY BIG BANKS OR INSTITUTIONS**, as opposed to actively-manages funds or having independent financial advisors, PLEASE LISTEN. A passively managed account [explained by investopedia here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/what-difference-between-passive-and-active-portfolio-management.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210125204113/https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/what-difference-between-passive-and-active-portfolio-management.asp) means the bank or institution will invest your savings "according to a strategy" instead of you having full control:



> 
> An *actively* managed investment fund has an individual portfolio manager, co-managers, or a team of managers all making investment decisions for the fund. The success of the fund depends on in-depth research, market forecasting, and the expertise of the management team. 
> 
> 
> A ***passive strategy*** does not have a management team making investment decisions and can be structured as an exchange-traded fund (ETF), a mutual fund, or a [unit investment trust](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uit.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210302171300/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uit.asp). 
> 
> 
> Index funds are branded as passively managed rather than unmanaged because each has a portfolio manager who is in charge of replicating the index.

Passive strategies are not "actively managed" for best results, but people trust that big banks have the smartest minds managing portfolios, and "[fiduciary obligations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210419155927/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp)" will require them to use those minds to act in my best interests, right??

Well, over the past 4 months of intense brain wrinkling, I learned that many brilliant minds think that a market crash is unavoidable in the near future.

It explains that they may not be safe from inflation after all *and* the Fed is buying up almost all of what the Treasury is issuing.

Reading is really hard so I had to use my crayons, but that says banks own over $163 **T**rillion in derivatives based on $19 Trillion of assets, and *Holding Companies* own over $218 **T**rillion in derivatives based on $17 Trillion of assets.

Dr. Brrrry posted the following chart on investments that have historically protected one from inflation by rising in value directly proportional to amount of inflation, [source:](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1363909572243705859) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210505184540/https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1363909572243705859)

The Q4 filings showing what Warren Buffet has been up to convinced me that all of this is real, [summarized on this webpage.](https://www.dataroma.com/m/m_activity.php?m=BRK&typ=a) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20201117014213/https://www.dataroma.com/m/m_activity.php?m=BRK&typ=a) Buffet, the guy who says "our favorite holding period is forever" and has always loved bank stocks, just sold huge amounts of stock- 100% out of some positions- here are some of the biggest sells:

He made some very significant buys as well:


![](/img/qerodihpx3u61.png)


![](/img/8mc5mywqx3u61.png)


His buys match up nearly perfectly with things that rise in value along with inflation according to Dr. Brrrrry's table. His sells match up nearly perfectly with all the banks and companies that will suffer if Brrrry's thesis about debt bubble bursting + inflation is correct. *Including selling off 100% of his position in gold.*


fuuuuuuuucccccccckkkkkkk.
=========================


Biases fully confirmed, I called my parents to warn them of things to come. (I posted that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/mt6fiq/psa_call_your_parents_and_ask_them_if_their/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210419092809/https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/mt6fiq/psa_call_your_parents_and_ask_them_if_their/).) My experience was unsettling- I learned that their retirement savings were in passively managed accounts through large institutions. My mom had chosen how "risky" she wanted her investments to be- she chose a 50/50 plan, she said- and let the institution allocate accordingly.


Turns out her investments are in 60% stocks, **40% bonds.** My dad has even more in bonds than that. I realize that this is a very common investment strategy for retirement funds, and in most markets provides a dependable, unchanging amount of money back-per-investment.


Dependable, unless you're concerned about a market crash, inflation, and [major dilution of the bonds market.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/flood-of-new-debt-tests-bond-market-11615372201) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210419133910/https://www.wsj.com/articles/flood-of-new-debt-tests-bond-market-11615372201)


BONDS WILL NOT PROTECT INVESTMENTS AGAINST INFLATION. BONDS DEPRECIATE 1:1 WITH THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR.

By the way, end of Feb 2021- [Warren Buffet has publicly stated that "bonds are dead."](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/01/buffett-says-bonds-are-dead-if-hes-right-heres-what-it-means-for-investors.html) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210318222326/https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/01/buffett-says-bonds-are-dead-if-hes-right-heres-what-it-means-for-investors.html) He did that in his [annual shareholder's letter](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/27/warren-buffetts-2020-shareholder-letter-highlights.html?&qsearchterm=warren%20buffett) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210419202114/https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/27/warren-buffetts-2020-shareholder-letter-highlights.html?&qsearchterm=warren%20buffett) this year. (Thanks u/arikah and u/theslipguy!!)

I then learned that my *husband's* parents employ an independent financial advisor to "actively manage" their retirement funds, paid on commission based on their fund's performance. That advisor had moved his parents' funds *almost entirely out of bonds,* ***and started doing so over four years ago.*** Neither of his parents work any more- they're entirely dependent on that money for the rest of their lives- it's not something they would take any risks with. Knowing that, their advisor *still* made this move *and* went so far as to give his parents a book, ["Be an Owner, Not a Loaner"](https://prezi.com/nwnd3jgtqff5/be-an-owner-not-a-loaner/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210419104353/https://prezi.com/nwnd3jgtqff5/be-an-owner-not-a-loaner/), explaining the difference between how bonds and stocks would retain value based on current market conditions.


Yet here were *my* parents, having chosen low levels of risk, having their money being invested in ***40%+ in bonds.***


If you check out [J.P. Morgan's retirement guide here,](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/retirement-insights/guide-to-retirement/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210406151450/https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/retirement-insights/guide-to-retirement/) they actually recommend a portfolio of **60% bonds** if you have "medium-term goals" like college or home loans.

![](/img/0q8igmowx3u61.png)


So.... according to the sacks at Sachs, my husband's retired parents have their money in the "highest risk" portfolio possible. Which doesn't make sense based on everything I know and have linked above, *especially* if there's a debt bubble about to burst, and one good catalyst could trigger it.


Then I happen to see this news posted: [**3 big banks hold largest bond sales ever this week.**](https://www.barrons.com/articles/goldman-sachs-bank-america-jpmorgan-bonds-dividends-51618602441) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210419110611/https://www.barrons.com/articles/goldman-sachs-bank-america-jpmorgan-bonds-dividends-51618602441) Bank of america sold $15 billion worth, JP Morgan sold $13 billion worth, and Goldman Sachs sold $6 billion.

![](/img/yj44hy18y3u61.png)


Strong correlation between debt over-exposure and the banks that Warren Buffet sold 100% of. So- why are banks rapidly unloading debt while ***clearly*** over-leveraged to debt while ***keeping*** debt in their *"low-risk"* retirement funds? Fiduciary responsibility my ass...


TLDR: make your own conclusions based on the facts above. I will be calling ape-mom and ape-dad about getting their retirement savings the hell out of bonds.
