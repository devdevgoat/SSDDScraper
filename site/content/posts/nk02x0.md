Ok, this morning's first 15 minutes was a pretty good control sample, as it shows a big price push down, bouncing off $180, then passing it, then beginning the push down again:

This is about on par with what we saw last week, with just under 37% of the trades vanishing after refresh. So I decided to hit up a stock with a lot higher trade volumes to compare numbers, Apple ($AAPL). Here's the window between 10:01-10:15

So, as you can see, there are still corrections... but significantly less so, by percentile. However, one has to acknowledge the possibility that the low trade volumes of GME are making a theoretically "standard" number of corrections per minute seem more statistically intense. So I found a stock with significantly LESS trade volume than GME, Costco ($COST). Here are the results from 10:31-10:45:

This is extremely low trading volume, and it seems to support the idea that the lower the trade volume is, the more likely the refresh is to be significantly different than the live data (holy shit, 10:39). But now I have entirely new questions, primarily, why are these always balancing down? There was one minute candle for GME last week that went up. If this were theoretically the effect of balancing trades and settlement from minute to minute, one would assume that the trades would come to roughly even over a segment of time (i.e., one minute lower than displayed live, one minute higher, etc.). So what the fuck is going on with HALF of the trades on this stock?


At this point, I'm really begging someone else with more trade settlement and reporting API infrastructure knowledge to let me in on what the fuck is going on here. I understand that there is expected to be some difference in accuracy between free trade tracking apps and a bloomberg terminal, but if the statistics that we retail traders are getting are off by *LITERALLY HALF,* how are we supposed to make any reliable trades? How is it possible that the trade volumes even on something as enormous as AAPL can be off by almost 10% as an average? *WHERE ARE THE FUCKING TRADES GOING?*


Edit: Clarity.
