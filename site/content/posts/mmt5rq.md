---April 9 update: This piece has been heavily edited from its original presentation. I've had plenty of shit talk about this post. I get it. Some of y'all think I'm fucking r*tarded for even posting this. But NOT ALL APES HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE JANUARY. I'm just trying to help in my limited capacity. And it seems to have helped thousands of apes get their affairs in order before liftoff, so I stand by this post. To be so smart as to correct me (rudely), you rude ones sure don't know how to read my disclaimers scattered all over this post 🧐 plus we figured out a record date in real time. Winning.


**UPDATE: I CAN'T EDIT THE TITLE BUT HOLY SHIT GUYS ITS LOOKING LIKE [4/15](http://imgur.com/a/QJqwTfw) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210408205943/https://imgur.com/a/QJqwTfw) RECORD DATE NOT 4/20 I THINK WE FIGURED IT OUT GOOD JOB APES**

1st Update: [A comment worth reading!!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mmt5rq/420_share_recall_explained_why_its_important_that/gttv4u8?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210408165219/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mmt5rq/420_share_recall_explained_why_its_important_that/gttv4u8/) Looks like Vanguard is reporting a deadline of April 15!!


TO ANSWER MY OWN QUESTION IDFK THE CATALYST NONE OF US DO. I'M NOT SAYING 4/20 IS ANYTHING BESIDES A (SUSPECTED) DEADLINE FOR RECALLING SHARES


The more shares recalled, the more the shorts need to cover!!


And [lenders are responsible for recalling shares, not Gamestop!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9eqv9/clarifying_share_recall_what_is_it_and_how_does/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210408143657/https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9eqv9/clarifying_share_recall_what_is_it_and_how_does/)


Comments are reporting that cash users with TDA and Fidelity do NOT lend out their shares. You will be notified more about voting through their platform when it's time. More brokerage updates from users in comments, but I would suggest you contact your broker yourself. Stay vigilant! Many brokers are automatic margin!!


Posting this before us 🦧 breed confusion... I know the [memes](http://imgur.com/gallery/gHBIpHq) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210408153949/http://imgur.com/gallery/gHBIpHq) are exciting, but they open lots of questions. I’m here to open my limited knowledge as well as start a discussion on what this means. Directly quoting u/Obvious\_Shake\_5012 here also.


So a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mmcgb6/got_this_email_back_from_rh_about_gme_shareholder/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)  [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210407212942/https://i.redd.it/kkmrwgiiktr61.jpg) on here shows a letter from Robinhood acknowledging a Gamestop Share Record date of 4/20. I contacted my main broker (I use several cuz I don’t trust a bitch) TD Ameritrade by phone and they confirmed this deadline for me. 


What does it mean, Pink?! 


The date of record, in this case ~~4/20~~ 4/15, is the deadline for shorts to return their shares. So a recall would be BEFORE 4/15 because 4/15 is the RECORD DATE . I.E Recall is NOW!


Did you read that, apes? THE DATE THE SHARES MUST BE RETURNED TO LENDERS BY SHORTS, VERIFIED AND ACCOUNTED FOR TO RECORD **YOUR** SHARES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO VOTE IN THE SHAREHOLDER MEETING. 


**YOUR SHARES**. This is UP TO US! 


⚠️ **Contact your brokers and RECALL YOUR SHARES!! Tell them you want to exercise your shareholder rights in the upcoming shareholder meeting.** ⚠️


*Do not fear the shills in the comments saying this is market manipulation or planned movement. None of that shit flies here, and all I'm saying is that you need to recall your shares before a certain deadline to exercise your shareholder right to vote. Nothing illegal about that!*


Keep in mind, Gamestop would need to have the 69.75 Mil shares accounted for (or however many are recalled) before shareholders can vote for anything important.


No this isn't a guarantee that anything will happen. But from a marketing standpoint, I sure as hell wouldn't be sending out PR without knowing for a fact things will be kosher enough to conduct business by the meeting date on **6/9 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)**


Inb4 naysayers say institutional whales don’t historically recall their shares and/or participate as voting shareholders in the annual meeting. WELL THIS YEAR IS FUCKING DIFFERENT HAS ANY OTHER YEAR BEEN THIS HISTORICALLY FUCKED?!


But just in case it *does* go according to historical trend...


Share recalls like to spark gamma squeezes. 


If shares are required for a shareholder vote, Gamestop will send public notice this Friday or Monday as this is 60 days before the meeting date. Who knows what will come of this. 


**These dates are factual and documented as far as I can tell, I am not making up my own target date or claiming anything here. Stay vigilant and do your own research!**


**4/20 BLAZE IT BITCHES**🔥🌬💨💨💨🌳🌳🌳🌳


Note: 


1. Yes you can still sell your shares if they are recalled. This simply means nobody is being "loaned" your shares. (To then take to the pawn shop like our boy Kenny G does.)
2. You must be a current shareholder as of the record date to vote.
3. We don't know what we're voting on yet, but im exercising my right to vote.
4. TDAmeritrade confirmed my shares are not leant out and I will be able to participate in the annual shareholders meeting.


Copied from a comment cuz I couldn't remember:


The notification will be through TDAmeritrade and will show up under "My Account --> Shareholder Library"
