**TL;DR: Margin is calling. Below is a list of a bunch of other stocks that SPECIFICALLY CITADEL is shorting into oblivion to make money to pay for their debt. Oh, by the way, it's not working out for them.**


**Not financial advice. I just like the stock. All of them.**


I'll keep this short and sweet, it's just a bunch of Ortex/FINRA data on **stocks that** **Citadel is MASS PRINTING** to make their money back. You will see some crazy shit here.


The goal of this DD is to **show the correlation between some MASSIVELY shorted stocks that have yet to cover as of 4/22** and **Citadel's involvement within the OTC/Dark Pools.**


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Let's start with the tendie man, $GME as our reference. Remember that **the short data for $GME is MASSIVELY INACCURATE because they have only pretended to cover by buying ITM calls.**


​

We know already what's going on with $GME, don't need to get into it. Same for $AMC. I would post photos of the Ortex and FINRA data but Reddit has a 20 image post limit. Dumb, but I'm sure you get the point.


Okay, here's where things get **CRAZY.** Have you heard of **Ocugen? ($OCGN)**


Neither had I. Until I noticed that **THE ENTIRE THING IS SHORTED TO 100% UTILIZATION AND MORE THAN THE FLOAT (189M) TRADED TODAY, 4/22.**


​

Here's the weird thing: **THE PRICE IS GOING** ***UP.*** Shorted stocks **DON'T GO UP. Unless... YOU'RE PRINTING SHARES JUST TO PRINT THEM TO MAKE MONEY WITH NO REPERCUSSIONS.**


Don't believe me? Well...


​

Did I mention that **THE PUBLIC FLOAT OF $OCGN IS ONLY 189M? SEEMS SUS...**


It goes deeper. Ever heard of $VXRT? You know, **THE ONE WITH THE NEGATIVE BETA?**


​

**Hmm I wonder if it's been shorted...**


​

**HMM, THAT'S STRANGE... BY CITADEL? YOU PRINTING SHARES OVER THERE?**


​


![](/img/lowjb5hv5vu61.jpg)


Well, isn't that interesting. Keep in mind too that the stock is **GOING UP** as well, meaning since they can't pull out, **THEY MUST GO DEEPER.** Just kidding, although remember that they **MAKE MONEY** printing shares, and demand has shot up for $VXRT.


Okay so what else? How about:


1. $FSR: **134M Float**
2. $NKLA: **169M Float**
3. $SKLZ: **227M Float**
4. $MVIS: **155M Float**
5. $RIOT: **82M Float**
6. $ALDX: **38M Float**
7. $BNGO: **276M Float**


Yup. And those are just the ones I found in a couple of hours. The list is **most likely enormous.**


You want the data? **Here's the data with comments on each image:**


Here's **$FSR:**

​

Here's **$NKLA:** Look at that **HUGE spike in volume, and there AIN'T NO SHORTS BEING COVERED.**


​

​


![](/img/a9dlrnx76vu61.jpg)


Here's $SKLZ. **Look at the price action at the end. It's GOING UP despite the short interest. Someone AIN'T COVERING.**


​

​

Here's **$MVIS, a WallStreetBets favorite.**


​

​


![](/img/2sgq1itf6vu61.jpg)


Here's **$RIOT.** Did you know that **THEY SHORTED IT BY TWICE ITS FLOAT OTC? (82M)?**


​


![](/img/1qys7unh6vu61.jpg)


​


![](/img/eyp9sqqj6vu61.jpg)


Here's **$ALDX.**


​


![](/img/amijboyl6vu61.jpg)


​


Here's **$BNGO. Again, look at the price action. It's going UP. And if shorts AREN'T RESPONSIBLE for it, then MARGIN CALLS will be coming for similar situations.**

**So what have we learned?**


**Buy more $GME. Buy more $AMC.** You can risk the other ones in this list, **but personally I like the stonk.** The way we win this thing **is if we HODL ON WHILE THE PRICE CLIMBS,** and while these stonks certainly can and most likely will go up, **they are more of a demonstration that Citadel and friends are most certainly fuk.** These stonks are shorted into oblivion to stave Citadel its execution, **which is coming for them very soon.**


Edit 1: Added some clarification, added "not financial advice," clarified that we actually just really like the stonk.
