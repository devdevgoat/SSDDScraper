" Also, the one talking about Citadel's total short positions is full of ridiculous assumptions. While it is interesting to see what Citadel's short position value was on 12/20/20, OPs leaps of faith using that info are incredibly shaky (ex. " assuming 50% of these short positions are in GME"....whoa, wait what?).


Please review and add a disclaimer." - u/justsaysso


" Don't get ahead of yourself, fellow ape. That's the amount of all their short positions combined, not just GME. Granted, it COULD just be GME, but it's highly doubtful that is the case. Either way, that was how many months ago? They've had plenty of time to keep digging that hole. PLUS, that doc only shows us their *reported* short positions. Them illegal naked shorts aren't going to be accounted for. Ya know, cuz illegal. THAT is the number I'm most interested in, though we may never get to know the truth. " - u/Bradduck\_Flyntmoore

by u/Alert\_Piano341


" I don’t like the reverse merger one. The intercept article it links to is the only thing I’ve read that makes me nervous about the squeeze. It’s worth taking the half hour or so to read through the series. It’s old and talks about naked shorting and how they get away with it. The counter dd people are always looking for: it isn’t that we are wrong. It’s that we are right and it doesn’t matter. I hope this one is too big and too public to be ignored. The new rules and hearings keep me optimistic. " - u/fraygul


" Clarifying question for you - are you saying you don’t like “the reverse merger one” because it linked to something that made you feel nervous?


Sure, this question has crossed my mind too because it’s a valid issue. We could be correct and do all the right things but could still get fukd. We won’t know yet. Until we find out. In the meantime, there’s a lot we can do to anticipate and learn about the fuckery that allowed them to get away with it in the past. So the value of articles/information shouldn’t be measured by how it makes us feel but how informed we are after reading it.


I see that you recommend folks read it but I’m confused by your opening and why you hold that against the reverse merger DD - which only had encouraging insights.


In other words, I wonder if that loophole is now closed to them for the few reasons I mentioned (and possibly more I haven’t thought of).


Edit: One thing to add - I’d have to research more into the obligation warehouse mechanism but I’m wondering if, for that loophole to work in favor of the short seller, *that’s* where they need a complicit issuer. Like, would the issuer have to sign off, so to speak, that the FTD’s are accounted for? I don’t know, smooth brain here but it sounds like the reverse merger can be leveraged in different ways, not just in favor of shorts." - u/blizzardflip


" It's not that the Intercept article makes [/u/fraygul](https://www.reddit.com/u/fraygul/) [(wb)](https://www.reddit.com/u/fraygul/) feel nervous; it's that the Intercept article states that because the old short positions under the old CUSIP can no longer be closed, they can actually be warehoused indefinitely as a liability that will eventually have to be paid off, but no longer have an imminent FTD pressure that the shorts have right now.


To quote the article directly:



> 
> Once that CUSIP changes, the naked shorter has no apparent way to close out the naked short position. No stock under the old CUSIP number exists anymore; it all automatically converts to the new CUSIP. 
> 
> 
> Those trades can sit in the Obligation Warehouse forever, in theory. But the “aged fails” — essentially orphaned naked short transactions — remain on the naked shorter’s balance sheet as a liability to be paid later.
> 
> 
> 


So instead of being a killshot for the hedge funds, this idea would actually be a killshot for the squeeze and the worst possible thing that could happen." - u/StringentCurry

" I can’t fully support the one by [u/keenfeed](https://www.reddit.com/u/keenfeed/) [(wb)](https://www.reddit.com/u/keenfeed/) because it calls on this sub to get politicians involved in a way that would make them easy targets for the people who don‘t want anything to change.


I like the idea of sending out a Master DD (even though I doubt it could be a short read), but getting politicians on live stream and having THEM ask us questions to educate themselves is a bit over the top imo.


[u/pinkcatsonacid](https://www.reddit.com/u/pinkcatsonacid/) [(wb)](https://www.reddit.com/u/pinkcatsonacid/) replied to it and outlined some points detailing why it‘s not a good idea and I wholeheartedly agree with her." - u/jonnyHDM


" Apes,


We know how eager everyone is to get involved and make a difference. However, please keep in mind that [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) [(wb)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) is a place for people from around the world to get together to share news, information, memes and comments about stonks.


Our AMAs are for informational purposes only. Our guests are here to inform us and to answer YOUR questions.


We are not a political group. Mods will not spearhead any political campaign nor will we reach out to any politician on behalf of [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) [(wb)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/).


There are several reasons for this, however the most important ones are:


1. Many of us, including several Mods, are not US citizens.
2. If [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) [(wb)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) reaches out to potentially "friendly" or "open minded" US politicians to try and "educate" or "inform" them, this is what will happen:
3. Mods and influential [r/superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstonk/) [(wb)](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstonk/) users will be targeted as "bad actors" who are attempting to exert foreign influence on US politicians and policy; and
4. Those politicians we reach out to, who may or may not be friendly, will be targeted as "compromised" and "under foreign influence/manipulation"
5. The result? All of a sudden, any positive changes they are attempting to make will be seen as "an attack on American Sovereignty" because they are "compromised" by "foreign manipulation"
6. Furthermore, politicians are not dumb. **You can bet that many of them are lurking on this sub, reading, watching and learning.** If they want to learn, they can and will do so.


If you want to get involved, all you have to do is watch our AMA with Dave Lauer or [read the transcript](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n7295i/david_lauer_ama_transcript_summary_22/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210508051610/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n7295i/david_lauer_ama_transcript_summary_22/). Here's a direct copy/paste from the transcript:



> 
> **WHAT CAN WE DO?**There have been questions about **what can we do** and to me this is one of those things that we can do.Another thing is you can just continue to make your voice heard, **you can file comment letters with the SEC or FINRA, that's an excellent way to get involved**, they do read them and **they do listen to well thought out comments, or well-researched comments.**You can contact your members of Congress because these bills that are going to come up are going to be controversial and they need to hear that there are people out there that support them, for good reasons.You can make use of the SEC and Office of the Investor Advocate who is there to advocate on your behalf and is often focused on institutional investors but would probably like to hear more from retail.And Gary Gensler I think in his testimony before Congress is going to say that they're requesting public input on some of these exact issues.So I think getting involved like that is just an *excellent thing*.It's great to have more involvement and more perspectives in this market structure debate, versus most of the people that are involved generally work for the high-frequency firms, the exchanges, the broker-dealersThere are very few of us out there who are not beholden to one of those types of firms and who are making money, actively, off of the current market structure.

If our American apes wish to contact their representatives **as individuals, please do so.**


However, the Mod Team will not be contacting anyone on behalf of the community, nor will we be involved with organizing any "Master DD", slideshows, or political AMAs.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation, apes.


🙏💪


**UPDATE:**


Many American apes are asking for information/websites/links on how to contact their representatives/SEC/FINRA. This is information that I'll be happy to provide. I'm at work right now but I'll look into it tonight and post something tomorrow.

To clarify, when you see trades "bounce" (erroneous trades that have been used to make the market but cannot be settled), you don't see the result on your end. The bad link in the chain is the brokers.


You see asian brokers limiting share purchases to 10 shares max? Or brokers locking down big orders, even for big boy ISDA players? That's where the user sees the impact of erroneous trades. The brokers get fucked and have to sort out the IOU's or just kind of sit there, deal with it, and try to buy more at any opportunity they can. They can't get their hands on the paper because when they try, the trades keep bouncing, so they get stuck with too few shares and have to start throttling things. Brokers are the share bottleneck right now, RH likely worse than others


The user just sees weird things happening all over the place with brokers and wonders wtf is up."
