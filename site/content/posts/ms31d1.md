Ending around 154.49, down 1.25%. Overall the 2nd lowest volume day since Jan. 


Have a great weekend everyone!


**Edit 12 3:29PM:**


We're on track for being the lowest volume day (less than 4.7 million) since before the Jan spike.


**Edit 11 2:43PM:**


2 hours of low volume lmao. ZZzzzzz. Hopefully we actually get some "power" during power hour.


Power hour: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6XoLaWv-Js&ab_channel=WardenElite> [(wb)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6XoLaWv-Js&ab_channel=WardenElite)

New resistance added at 158.5.


**Edit 6 10:47AM:**


Moving up on low volume. Nothing significant happening yet.


**Edit 5 10:26AM:**


Nothing really happening so far. A couple 160 and 200 strike Calls sold. Probably sold to close or covered calls.

First minute candle 192k volume. Pretty low. Perhaps a quiet market open followed by a bang later in the day.

==================


Gooooooood morning my fellow apes!


Well the day has finally come. The great exercise day. By exercise, I mean stand up in your room and stretch your arms. Do some jumping jacks and prepare for whatever the heck GME has in store for us today.

We saw a bit of a pullback on Thursday, and I'm expecting Friday to be a continuation of Wednesday's mad rally. Seems DFV has been on a bit of a tweeting spree recently. Maybe he knows something is up? Getting a bit pumped for what will happen very soon? Who knows. All I know that he knows, is that he really likes the stock. So do I.


Premarket Analysis
==================


Shorts really do love hammering it in the premarket. Broader market gapping up in the premarket but GME hammered down.
