---Hello SuperStonk,


I'm u/Doom\_Douche , You may remember me from posts such as ["Deep Dive into Dark Pool Trading - How they might accidentally be showing us the number of synthetic shares"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mv5kbm/deep_dive_into_dark_pool_trading_how_they_might/) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210421113939/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mv5kbm/deep_dive_into_dark_pool_trading_how_they_might/) or ["My banner submission.

I don't know what the hell I'm doing and I would rather be making memes but you asked for it and you are gonna get it. In my last post there were a lot of requests to incorporate exchange volume into the calculations and compare it against other wonky stocks rather than blue chips. This makes sense as GME is anything but normal.


I identified two of the most heavily traded OTC stocks and compared our favorite stonk against it. Spoiler alert GME is way wackier.


**Let's start with the ELIA**. We all believe GME is heavily manipulated. We all believe the float isn't real. We all smell the fart in the room but no one is admitting who did it. I would like to believe all my data can be summed up in this one image.

There is a massive battleship entering the port. We know this. We can see the shadow it casts through institutional ownership, retail brokerage numbers and a variety of other ways. The public sees a tiny strip mall video game store with anemic volume and an outdated business model. What I am pointing out is the amount of OTC volume compared to the completely fictitious float. This is the wake, the amount of water displaced by the ship. We are told its a dinky little kayak when in reality its a battleship about to blow up the entire market. Lets get into the data!


I am using all the OTC data available in 2021 for GME and the following stocks which were identified in multiple articles as the most heavily traded OTC. Much of this data is delayed reporting up to 4 weeks and the data is displayed as weekly volume not daily. This will cause flat areas in graphs compared to daily spikes you will see in exchange volume. This is just the nature of the beast but trust me that I have cross referenced the data based on actual trading days and it all lines up properly.

Oooph. Thats a lot of numbers but there are already some interesting conclusions that can be drawn just by totals and averages. Let's look closer.

Compared to these clown stocks GME actually seems normal at first glance. Gamestop is seeing on average 25% of all volume traded OTC vs 96% of all volume traded OTC with GTBIF. Let's expand this data to make sure we are all on the same page.


![](/img/5wzmqc4jbyv61.jpg)
Here is the same data plotted over time. Exactly what you would expect to see. GME OTC volume hanging under exchange volume, GBTC OTC volume rising mostly above exchange volume and GTBIF OTC volume dwarfing exchange volume.


Now here is where the system breaks. Lets keep a very important premise in mind


**All of this data and all of these calculations are operating under the assumption that the "float" is correctly reported as 51.46 million.**


![](/img/pbtahu4efyv61.jpg)
OK, WHAT THE FUCK. GME has more than double the ratio of OTC Volume/Float than the stock with the highest percentage of OTC Volume. Let me be as clear as possible. GME has an average of around 30% of its float traded OTC. From my previous post you will see that most companies have an average of LESS THAN 1% of their float traded OTC. The wackiest company I can find that has over 96% of all volume traded OTC has only 14% of its float traded OTC.


When presented with unreasonable numbers in a calculation it is important to consider the possibility that some of your data is incorrect. The only variable that we can change that would effect the outcome of our calculations is the FLOAT.


If we were to wave a magic wand and assume that GME has a single synthetic share trading for every real share out there the Ph(loat) which is synthetic shares+ real shares would be 110,980,000. Even using that number we still get a OTC Volume/Float percentage higher than GTBIF at 14.94%.

hahahahahhahahahHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHhahahhahahahahahHAHAHAHAHAHHA


Ok I got that out of my system. I don't fucking know dude. You know who knows what the real float is?


NO ONE


Not Ryan Cohen, Not Kenny G, Not THE SEC


All I can show you is that its way bigger than any of us are prepared for. Here is what's really coming into port.

Put on your lifejackets ape. It's about to get choppy.


TLDR: The float is fucking huge yo


Edit 1: Here is a google drive link to the data if anyone wants to play with it

Edit 2: To be clear when I say the "Float is bigger than anyone expects" I am referencing the Ph(loat) not the reported true float. The Ph(loat) is comprised of mostly synthetic shares combined with the real float of 54 mil and not being reported as there is no publicly available metric to calculate synthetic shares. This means the short interest is still well over 100% and likely much.... much... more than that.


Edit 3: u/db2 brought up a fantastic point. If I am right and that's a big IF, the reason the borrow rate for GME is so low is because its incredibly easy to borrow shares. If the PH(loat) is gigantic because its full of synthetic shares it would explain why GME has a borrow rate of only 1.1% interest


Edit 4: u/Rumblebully suggested using the terminology Phloat for describing the combination of real float + synthetic or phantom shares and I fucking love it. From now on i'm calling it Ph(loat) and no one can stop me.
