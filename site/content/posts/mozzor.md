---Greetings everyone,


I like to start off saying: This is not financial advice and everyone is open to punch holes in these numbers.


For smooth brain apes TL;DR is at the bottom.


I've heard a lot of people say: "Don't trust my word, do your own DD". So i did.


I looked at the values on [shortvolumes.com](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=gme) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413162449/http://shortvolumes.com/?t=gme). And for a lot of consecutive days, the volume short was more than half the total volume of the day. Which means, if you only take that day, the total amount of shorts that are not covered adds up.


Thought example:
If the volume short is 55% of the volume of the day, that means it could have covered with the remaining 45% of the day. Which means 10% of the volume of that day adds up to the pile.


[My DD - "The Pile"](https://imgur.com/a/3dD9OPv) [(wb)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210411213813/https://imgur.com/a/3dD9OPv)
Little discussion point: I only took the values from the 13th of January and up, because that's the day the volume started kicking. This is in favor of the shorties, as the maximum shorts open gets smaller.


So for this DD I assumed that EVERY long trade that was done on a date, was to cover all open shorts on that date. The last date that shorties could have fully covered was the 26th of January.


As seen in my excel sheet, the 'Minimal Cumul per date' is the Pile. Every day that the short% is below 50%, the Pile shrinks. Every day that the short% is above 50%, the Pile enlargens.


TL;DR / Conclusion:
This means that the total open shorts are at least 60.721.275 shares (110,93% of the free float) This is assuming that no other trade was made except closing shorts, if YOU or your brother, uncle, dad or neighbour's cat bought a share, this number goes higher.
It could be a maximum of 856.523.374 (1564,71% of free float, only counting from the 13th of January and up).

Edit 1:
Forgot exit quotes on line 4.


Edit 2:
/u/Diamond\_Thumb pointed out a fair point. I would like to quote him:
"...It should be made clear, that you can't calculate SI since it's giving a range of 110%-1500%. The thing I think people should take away is that the bi-monthly SI reported is 10m shares, verses this which is over 75m shares minimum, meaning that they either got a shit tonne of shares through dark pools somehow or the bi-monthly data is inaccurate. Establishing how inaccurate is another thing, but could be done if we could get up to date numbers on who's holding how many shares."
I couldn't have worded it better. My intention was only to point out the minimum amount of shorts that should still be open.


Edit3:
Allright I am ending my discussions for now and I am going to bed guys, it‚Äôs 1:40 AM here. Have a good night and keep HODL‚Äôing tomorrow!


Edit4:
A lot of people pointed out that shortvolume =/= short interest. I get this point, however I do believe there is a correlation with the amount of unclosed shorts and shortvolume. The numbers mentioned in this post may be off. I will look into this matter and post an update of ‚Äúthe Pile‚Äù next saturday!
