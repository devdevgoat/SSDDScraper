---This is a summary of what we have discovered:


üçå


Citadel adds a new branch to hide certain holdings (Ashler)


Obtains a large portion of Freddie Mac (percent not known)


Some insane shit goes down in January with their books


Major drama and defaults happen, all connected to Citadel


New rules are passed by the govt in record time because Citadel is way too connected to the housing market/ commercial properties


May 10 - We get the "wind-down plan"


Members from Freddie Mac bail the same day


May 11 = Freddie Mac (listed under Ashler) filings released


**AND NOW IT‚ÄôS GETTING UGLLLY!!! ¬†(stay with us here.. its deep, and connected globallyüåéüåçüåè)**

On March 10th, 2021, the SR-NSCC-2021-003 Rule change request was filed. This was to require more regular position confirmations and clarity.


On March 24th, the DTCC officially eliminated month-end reporting and changed this to daily.


By April 6th, DTCC-2021-005 went into effect, which prevented shares from being used as collateral within the market, multiple times. Tightening up these loopholes makes it harder for naked shorting to have its place in the market.¬†


On April 16th, the DTC-2021-006 Rule change was requested, preventing more shares of a company to be traded than exist, which is still in review.


On top of all these laws and regulations rolling out, GameStop also has a proxy voting for the shareholder meeting currently taking place. It is expected that GameStop will receive more votes than shares accounted for, showing over selling within the market. These voters can only vote if you own shares in the company, and a number is provided by brokers to individuals. See Wes‚Äô AMA if you need to know more on this topic.


**Every name on a 257-page ADV doc that is affiliated with Citadel Advisors LLC has made the news lately showing heavy losses, extreme stress, or is doing weird sh*t (BofA/ JP Morgan). ¬† That same document shows 19 umbrella companies connected to Citadel. They are worldwide and the implosion proves to be nasty AF.¬† Blackrock has been buying shares (not calls) like crazy. The same shares that Citadel has heavy shorts and puts in. Blackrock has been buying up housing. Blackrock has been buying shares in everything Citadel is short on. Citadel bought a crapload of bank assets on 08 before everything exploded.**

Section 5 Bottom right of the page shows them all. 7.7 billion dollars worth.


These are all sales. Everybody that's buying them is getting f*cked but it shows how bad they're looking for money by selling off this much in assets.


All purchased 2008-01-01

**So... Madison Dearborn, Ashler, and Citadel (and others) are all essentially the same company, or at least connected through bank accounts. ¬† Madison is buying up assets after Kenny's group of shorters f*cked those companies into the ground. ¬† We now know that this is 2008 2.0 but this time, with commercial properties.¬† Ashler = Freddie Mac.¬† BofA is now connected to Citadel after permanently closing a ton of branches.**
