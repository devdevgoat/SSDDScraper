**Edit 21 4:09PM:**


Have a good weekend everyone! Treat yourself, have a good break, you deserve it! It's been a long week of boring sideways and downward movements. Super low volume all week. I hope we get a good show next week!


**Edit 20 4:03PM:**


Ending around 158.32, down -7.01%. I'm expecting some action next week, nearing the apex of the triangle wedge.


**Edit 19 3:38PM:**


Ending around the 156.5-162.5 channel.

**Edit 17 2:12PM:**


Great summary of the current ongoing battle:


![](/img/xxg2zv1av6s61.png)
**Edit 16 1:58PM:**


Raw beta -0.8, adj beta -0.2.


**Edit 15 1:30PM:**


160 strike puts keeping the price low.

**Edit 14 1:17PM:**


Checking Bloomberg Terminal. Institutional ownership actually up 3%! we've gone up this week from 131% to 142%!


Retail ownership has also gone up! The buy sell ratio was really high through this month.


**Edit 13 1:13PM:**


A fade is when volume does not support price trend. It's a sign of manipulation. Here we see the volume is not increasing as the price is decreasing. This is a sign of shorting and artificial price suppression. Nothing to see here folks. Buy and hold, diamond hands.

**Edit 12 12:48PM:**


Puts dragging the price lower. I'm holding.

**Edit 11 12:42PM:**


What is this crazy OI for the VIX? Hedge against a market crash?


![](/img/lucw5ai8f6s61.png)
**Edit 10 12:24PM:**


Dip happening a bit lower than 162. Next support is around 156.5.


**Edit 9 11:44AM:**


Scratch that, those puts are smack in the middle. No idea if they were bought or sold.


![](/img/utwndklu46s61.png)
**Edit 8 11:41AM:**


Those puts were mostly sold. Overall bullish options activity.

**Edit 7 11:18AM:**


IV rounding off again. I'll be back on stream at 11:30am EDT. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQv9g-EwIVM&ab_channel=WardenElite> [(wb)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQv9g-EwIVM&ab_channel=WardenElite)

**Edit 6 10:57AM:**


It seems the bounce earlier today seems to confirm the diagonal support outlined in red. Looks like the wedge is almost done forming. The Apex is projected to be formed early next week.


We can expect the price to bounce more within this triangle before the breakout. I believe there is a good amount of upside left for today.


![](/img/s63xv2fgw5s61.png)
**Edit 5 10:40AM:**


Options look mostly bullish. Not a ton of orders have been put in yet. Mostly small to moderate side orders.

**Edit 4 10:38AM:**


This midterm is actually super chill. I'll be done soon. GME trading sideways tangling around VWAP right now.


**Edit 3 9:53AM:**


Nice little local dip at 9:49am. It could still go lower around 162.5.


![](/img/8j4ophn4l5s61.png)
**Edit 2 9:34AM:**


We can expect a dip today as a result of the low volume, perhaps around 9:40-10:15am. Let's find out.


**Edit 1 9:33AM:**


Low volume first minute candle, around 200k.

==================


Gooooooood morning my beautiful silverback apes!


We're playing the waiting game now. The record date is 4/15 and a potential catalyst is a share recall between now and the 15th.


I expect we'll some noise next week, but for this Friday, I do not expect a squeeze to start.


I'm streaming in 2 parts today since I have a midterm from 10am EDT to 11:30am EDT. So Part 1 will come before 10am, <https://youtu.be/h-JGcY2Ttyg> [(wb)](https://youtu.be/h-JGcY2Ttyg), and part 2 will be after 11:30am. I'll post a link when Part 2 is ready.


Premarket Analysis
==================


We're barely down in the premarket. Gapup at 4am followed by a move down. There's no unusual volume in the premarket, so something tells me that today might be another low volume day.

The broader market is starting in the red today.
