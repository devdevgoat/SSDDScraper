---So, from one smoothbrain to another. Apparently that [u/Atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/Atobitt/) [(wb)](https://www.reddit.com/u/Atobitt/) thing with his GOD TIER DD "House of cards" made some folks very insecure. Fuck, even I was completely devastated yesterday when I read it. With huge efforts I got my first wrinkle after thinking this through. Since I am not a genius, but I still want to pollute the internet like any other moron with my uninformed, unasked opinion, here is what I came up with, in hopes of helping some of you to make the right decision.


I try to keep this brief and explicitly declare theory, thesis, hypothesis and my own assumptions, opinions and moves, so you can easily distinguish between facts and opinions.


​


**1. The GME-bet**


* **Theory**: Supply and demand dictate price.
* **Thesis**: Gamestop stock has been shorted excessively.
* **Hypothesis**: When shorts have to be covered, the demand and therefore the price skyrockets.
* **My Move**: I buy Gamestop shares and hold them, until shorts are covering, to make big profits.


We knew that already. But now we know, that we never owned any shares, we just owned IOUs.


​


**2. The house of cards**


* **Theory**: A corp (DTCC, DTC, Cede & Co., whoever, doesn't matter) is the actual owner of the share and just issues an IOU for all investors, which basically grants them the same rights the actual shareholder has (dividends, voting rights, etc.).
* **Thesis**: Supply and demand of the stock is heavily distorted. It's not about supply and demand of a share, it's about supply and demand of an IOU. The currupt system itself is manipulating the price.


​


**3. Doubt and insecurity**


* **Assumption of some comerades-in-arms** (read that today): "Yes, but if the DTCC is corrupt itself, hodling won't do anything!"


I was yesterday at this exact same point. I thought long and hard about it, made up my mind and planned my next steps. It doesn't matter, if they shorted a stock, IOUs, bananas, clouds or paper clips, because...

**4. Shorts must cover**


* **Thesis**: **Shorts must cover.**
* **Hypothesis**: If shorts aren't covered, the american stock market loses any credibility and reputation worldwide.
* **Assumption**: Wallstreet can literally not afford the world stopping to trade with them. They will therefore cover their shorts. The question's only when.
* **Assumption / opinion** (even sub-bulletpoints): They stall / buy time to mitigate damage. They need to make precautions to avoid being utterly annihilated. This mitigation happens at multiple fronts.
* They use misinformation, threats, legal actions, shills and time to create panic and make as many shareholders as possible sell their shares. This reduces the number of shorts and therefore their losses. This is what we have seen every day for the last few months.
* But behind the scenes, there is something much bigger going on (Caution: put on your tinfoil hat)They move as much money as possible to safety and make it disappear (in Off-Shore-accounts, as cash, as gold or silver, etc.), so they don't have to cover the shorts with their own money. That's what insurance is for, right? Why should they liquidate all their assets, when insurance will take care of this?
* Moving such huge amounts of money requires time. I'm not talking about the time to complete transactions. That's one thing, but they need to destroy any evidence of that money. Invoices and documents that record why this money is gone, for what it was spent and where it is now. It's time consuming to bribe the right people, call the right numbers and partake in all those emergency-meetings.


​


**5. What does this mean for us?**


* **Opinion**: We won. Cannons fired. The enemy ship is sinking. The crew is running to the lifeboats like the rats they are. The most depressing thing? They will get away in those "lifeboats", their yachts, helicopters and private jets. They will stay rich and die rich. Maybe the american government will learn from this and prevent this in the future.
* **Thesis**: The squeeze will happen. Doesn't matter when. We will get our money from the insurance.
* **My Move** (as before): I buy Gamestop shares and hold them, until shorts are covered, to make big profits.


​


Nothing changed.
