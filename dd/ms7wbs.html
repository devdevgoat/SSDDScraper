<p>Apes, I would like you to meet Motley Fool Asset Management <a href="https://www.mfamfunds.com/index.html">https://www.mfamfunds.com/index.html</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210416151127/https://www.mfamfunds.com/index.html"> (wb)</a>, the sister company of the Motley Fool.</p>
<p>This company has several funds and ETFs on their site. So I took a look at the top holdings for each one then did a search on motley fool for their articles to see if they are upholding their mission to  <a href="https://www.fool.com/legal/the-motley-fool-disclaimer/">help readers obtain financial information and discuss ways to make investment and personal financial decisions</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210126110256/https://www.fool.com/legal/the-motley-fool-disclaimer/"> (wb)</a> are just a propaganda machine to boost the stock prices of their holdings <strong>(spoiler alert: It's the propaganda one)</strong></p>
<p>You can find their funds here: <a href="https://www.mfamfunds.com/our-products.html">https://www.mfamfunds.com/our-products.html</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210210021150/https://www.mfamfunds.com/our-products.html"> (wb)</a></p>
<p>---------- <strong>#1 Holding: Amazon</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon is their number 1 holding in their FOOLX fund</strong> but can be found at some % on most of them**.** And just take a look at the articles. literally they are banging out 3-4 articles A DAY saying how amazing Amazon is</p>
<p>​</p>

<p>​</p>
<p><strong>---------- #2 Holding: Watso Inc.</strong></p>
<p>This is the <strong>number 1 holding in their TMFGX fund.</strong> I had never heard of this company, but motley fool has over 100 articles about it and once again all singing its praises.</p>
<p>​</p>
<img src="img/u7jcbrvtgkt61.png"/>
<p><strong>---------- #3 Holding - Apple</strong></p>
<p>Apple is their <strong>number 1 holding in their motley fool 100 ETF (TMFC)</strong> and they actually <strong>wrote some negative articles</strong> about them... <strong>just kidding!</strong></p>
<p>​</p>

<p><strong>---------- GME</strong></p>
<p>AAAAANNNNDDD now let's get to GME:</p>
<p>​</p>
<img src="img/rhn78akyhkt61.png"/>
<img src="img/7brwqb47ikt61.png"/>
<p>As you can see, not so great. They even did some comparisons between amazon, i wonder what they suggested...</p>
<p>​</p>
<img src="img/lfxkxsbpikt61.png"/>
<p><strong>Now some of you may "wait, this seems like blatant market manipulation?" and if this was a just world then answer would be DUH!!!</strong> </p>
<p><strong>BUTTTTT, at the bottom of their articles, they disclose that they do have a position in the stock (and even their call option recommendations...), its just in size 5 font after another long disclaimer.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>So at least they are nice enough to let you know they are manipulating you if you bother to read the fine print.</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<img src="img/2b6r3y0zbmt61.png"/>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> so i clicked on their disclosure policy <a href="https://www.fool.com/legal/fool-disclosure-policy/">https://www.fool.com/legal/fool-disclosure-policy/</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141254/https://www.fool.com/legal/fool-disclosure-policy/"> (wb)</a> and found this GEM:</p>
<p>​</p>
<img src="img/xpwt5n3i9mt61.png"/>
<p>and also this from their disclaimer page <a href="https://www.fool.com/legal/the-motley-fool-disclaimer/">https://www.fool.com/legal/the-motley-fool-disclaimer/</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210126110256/https://www.fool.com/legal/the-motley-fool-disclaimer/"> (wb)</a></p>

<p><strong>So funny that they say that they are not here to give you buy or sell recommendations when they literally say "Recommends Apple. The Motley Fool recommends the following options..."</strong></p>
<h1>So if you had any doubt about the purpose of motley fool, it is just propaganda to prop up their holdings and downplay any other company that could threaten them.</h1></content></body>
