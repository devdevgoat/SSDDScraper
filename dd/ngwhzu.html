<content><p><strong>Hello Fellow Apes,</strong></p>
<p>I am writing this post to let Apes know that I was able to follow-up through the SEC and the DTCC on <strong>SR-DTC-2021-005</strong> and to the follow-up on work in my initial post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mzkf8v/where_is_srdtc2021005/">here</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210427091928/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mzkf8v/where_is_srdtc2021005/"> (wb)</a>, and providing you now with the status update I received.</p>
<p><strong>I would also like to report that the SEC and the DTCC once again were very gracious and timely in their responses.</strong></p>
<p>For those not familiar with <strong>SR-DTC-2021-005 and what it does.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In short, SR-DTC-2021-005</strong> would limit the ability of market makers and hedge funds working together to reset FTD transactions and/or conceal short positions through nefarious options trading.</p>
<p>There are some great DD's on this rule by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/bigbrainbets/">u/bigbrainbets</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/bigbrainbets/"> (wb)</a> ; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lighthouse30130/">u/lighthouse30130</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lighthouse30130/"> (wb)</a>, and others, and good follow-up work by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/kamayatzee/">u/kamayatzee</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/kamayatzee/"> (wb)</a> .</p>

<p>Now,</p>
<p>Below is the chain of communication between myself , the SEC, and the DTCC on the whereabouts of SR-DTC-2021-005.</p>
<p><strong>TL:DR</strong></p>
<p><strong>SR-DTC-2021-005. was reviewed by the SEC. The filing is currently being finalized for filing at the DTCC. It will be filed shortly. And once it is filed, it becomes effective!!</strong></p>
<p>When the rule is filed it will be posted here with any other DTC rules on the DTCC website <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings.aspx">https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings.aspx</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210412181351/https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings.aspx"> (wb)</a></p>
