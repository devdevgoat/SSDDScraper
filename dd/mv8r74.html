<content><p>Hes referring to Ted 2 In his tweet </p>
<p>https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1384616641087086596?s=21</p>
<p>In the US we never saw this ad but in Europe it was all over. How do I know? I live in Europe now. </p>
<p>I showed it to my gf and she said “ah I know that bear, that’s from T2”</p>
<p>I said what do you mean T2 and she said yea it’s from a movie called T2. So i asked her why she called it that and she said she never saw the movie but that it was advertised as T2 in this ad where he is shaking a martini and turns around. </p>
<p>I came on here and I found this post </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mv740t/january_22_february_19_march_5_april_16_the_only/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</p>
<p>Where he refers to T+2 being important. </p>
<p>Ryan Cohen tweeted about Ted 2 or T2</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Here’s proof that it was for Ted 2</p>

<p>In the ad it says, Ted comes again</p>
<p>EDIT 2: </p>
<p>I don’t think he means that something will happen, but I think he meant to keep and eye on the FTDs by watching the T+2, at least that’s how interpret it. If you notice the gif is doing one thing but then turns out to be another, so that’s how I see it T+2 is supposed to do one thing but may do another, what it will do idk</p></content></body>
