<p><strong>Edit 17 4:02PM:</strong></p>
<p>Ended around 186.13 for the day, small bounce in the last few minutes!</p>
<p>Overall a great day, see you all tomorrow!</p>

<p><strong>Edit 16 3:46PM:</strong></p>
<p>Low volume, should finish above 182 for the day. Added a new 182 support.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 15 3:04PM:</strong></p>
<p>Back for power hour!</p>

<p><strong>Edit 14 2:26PM:</strong></p>
<p>Quick summary of how to detect a short squeeze 24 hours before the squeeze.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/script/nO5Y6yTa-CV-VWAP-GME/">https://www.tradingview.com/script/nO5Y6yTa-CV-VWAP-GME/</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210228095106/https://www.tradingview.com/script/nO5Y6yTa-CV-VWAP-GME/"> (wb)</a> and favorite the CV VWAP indicator.</p>
<p>Then in TradingView, turn that indicator on under the favorites list. It's pretty simple to use.</p>
<img src="img/dcxwccsceer61.png"/>
<p>Basically if the silver line goes near or above the dotted red line above, its a positive signal for an incoming short squeeze. Don't pay attention to the indicator during AH or PM. Only during trading hours.</p>
<p>There's a couple false signals and intricacies of how to read the signals properly. I explained it early on in my stream today.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 13 1:37PM:</strong></p>
<p>We were quite close to crossing 200 like my friend in the chat had predicted. We touched 195. Close enough!</p>
<p>I'll be back at power hour, mostly just sideways trading on low volume right now.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 12 1:09PM:</strong></p>
<p>Nothing crazy happening, we're sagging towards VWAP, volume dying down.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 11 12:14PM:</strong></p>
<p>Local double top. Stock will consolidate a bit lower.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 10 11:38AM:</strong></p>
<p>Gap fill today.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 9 11:31AM:</strong></p>
<p>WE GOIN UP!</p>

<p><strong>Edit 8 11:27AM:</strong></p>
<p>Rough rough prediction for the week. Letting that IV crush.</p>
<img src="img/qgvay8dbidr61.png"/>
<p><strong>Edit 7 11:21AM:</strong></p>
<p>Someone shorted 1m worth of Puts at the 200 strike. This is very bullish imo.</p>
<img src="img/91cbmrm3hdr61.png"/>
<p><strong>Edit 6 11:19AM:</strong></p>
<p>Mostly bullish in terms of options activity. Lots of long calls getting put in.</p>
<img src="img/cxagj1drgdr61.png"/>
<p><strong>Edit 5 11:09AM:</strong></p>
<p>Decently low volume. We're finding a good consolidation zone between 176.5 and 184 channel.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 4 10:05AM:</strong></p>
<p>I will be on in 10 minutes, did you all catch the dip?</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3 9:34AM:</strong></p>
<p>No one is selling haha. Look at that low volume!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2 9:31AM:</strong></p>
<p>Reminder I have a meeting until 10:15 EDT. Use everything I showed you guys to find a dip! You guys got this!</p>
