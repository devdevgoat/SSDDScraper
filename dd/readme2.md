Hello my dear Apes, I come bulling gifts!! 

As we all saw this morning, one little snip here, or fat check there, and our entire network crumbles. This is not acceptable, and WILL happen when the MOASS starts. So what is there to do?? 

I know I know, everyone go ghingam style... but when that goes down too, and we're scattered amongst twitter trying to share dropbox links, people will get nervous.

We need something safer, more robust, and not owned by anyome... especially me!!
