Hello my dear Apes, HAPPY 300!!!! I come bulling gifts!! 

As we all saw this morning, one little snip here, or fat check there, and our entire network crumbles. This is not acceptable, and this WILL happen when the MOASS starts. So what is there to do?? 

I know I know, everyone is all "go ghingam style!!" but when that goes down too, and we're scattered amongst twitter trying to share dropbox links, people will get nervous. Did that DD ever actually exists?!?! HOW DO I KNOW FOR SURE?!?! IT"S BEEN 10 MINUTES!!!

We need something safer, more robust, and more importantly, not owned by anyone who can go shill at the drop of a dime... especially me!!

So here's what I built. I'm not some fancy smancy financial anaylst, or a bad ass micro expression expert, but I can scrub web content with cobbled together code snippets from stack overflow! So I copy and pasted my way to a V1 one of a DWeb site that supports the following features:

* Hosted and pinned on IPFS, which means the content is spread across hundreds of nodes, you can even host your own in Brave Browser. I can delete it off my machine and it won't matter, someone eles has already replicated the content and it [can't be modified!!](http://docs.ipfs.io.ipns.localhost:8080/concepts/immutability/)
* All (or nearly all) evidence downloaded and stored on IPFS locally, so if someone deletes shit from imgur or reddit images, fuck 'em, we got our copy and that shits INLINE! (except for albums/gallary's, that shits complicated, but see last bullet for workaround)
* While copying the content I went ahead and re-published all dd to wayback machine, and grabbed the links closest to original posting time
* And since I was spamming wayback anyway, I did the same for ALL embedded links, creating a new wayback archive (unless one near posting existed alread)! However, I still need a solution for youtube links, I backed up all the youtube links to a file so we can scrub those seperatly... maybe use a webtorrent video solution for these?? Suggestions welcome!
* Oh, and I injected the wayback links inline to the post as well, so if you're readding HOCII and the fuckers tried to edit Investing.com's definition of "fuk'd" you can see the original

Couple thing to note:
* You can access the site via my eth url, but one problem with the immutability concept, I can't add NEW dd to that page, so I have to build a new one and repbulish with the updated, which means a new CID. If the owners of superstonk.eth see this contact me and we can try to get a better ens link setup. For now, I have to manually update the ens to point to the new page...sucks, but its a small price to pay for permenace. Not sure if we can use an orbitdb node in browser to solve this or not??
* Note, linking via ens is not the same as DNS, anyone can do it, you can host the same site at 'badadddddick.eht' it doesn't matter, it's just a link to the ipfs CID... I don't own this data anymore, it out in the wild forever! Woot!!

Further more, we need a more resilient chat system. Twitter is great, but I think iris.to would be better, especially compared to discord that can be shut down with a few spammed reports. I've not really used it much, and I'm not affiliated with it, but I created a room called Superstonk here: 

https://iris.to/?channelId=fa88c760-c1d1-4cc6-ab97-fa125296168a&inviter=eVG59A0lM_xoTmDC-6KHe_knfuy8BAmVfIh9GPNJZf0.pDiCCkNp8GYw8fES089y4YOITmV03r8VpG9CPvYJdyg&s=fEUAO58l3zQv4SEuDvVrX5DgD_rCFZM5gieaW77Z1m0&k=X9kKDXMdYvVT

@mods, contact me via verifiable means and I'll make your iris account the owner of this group. I don't want this to be a shill vector by adding some rando to the mix (me). The whole point of this is that I can disappear and it doesn't matter!!

hmmm lets see...what else. Oh, I published the whole thing (included dd text, but not images...sry i'm on a free account til MOASS) to github here. DONT LAUGH AT MY CODE IT WORKS DAMNIT!
