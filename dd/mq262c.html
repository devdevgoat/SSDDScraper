<p><strong>Historical supports and resistances:</strong></p>
<p>116.5, 125.5, 132.5, 141, 145, 147.5, 150, 152.5, 156.5, 162.5, 172, 174, 176.5, 179, 180.5, 182, 183.5, 184.5, 186, 187.5, 190.5, 192, 195, 196.5, 197.5, 200, 209, 211.5, 214.5, 218, 226, 230, 234, 243, 250, 253, 256.5</p>
<p><strong>Edit 15 4:00PM:</strong></p>
<p>Closing around 140.79, down 0.21%. Overall a sideways and pretty quite day.</p>
<p>See you all tomorrow! I'm looking forward to the end of the week.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 14 3:55PM:</strong></p>
<p>TTM Squeeze at 15 minutes seems to indicator a pre squeeze consolidation. Note the red dots.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 12 1:59PM:</strong></p>
<p>So far in my opinion, the play is going as expected.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 11 12:51PM:</strong></p>
<p>There is a strange amount of short Puts at the 100 strike. Could either be CSPs looking to buy in after a predicted crash to around 100, or could just be someone farming premiums. Hard to say for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 10 12:49PM:</strong></p>
<p><strong>zzZZZ...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edit 9 11:17AM:</strong></p>
<p>680 strike Calls were bought today, expiring around October/November. I'm thinking it could just be a way to deal with theta time decay. The further OTM Calls have issues with time, so if the strike date is placed further, it helps a lot, though at the expense of less leverage.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 8 11:15AM:</strong></p>
<p>Bid ask spread getting tighter. We're trading tightly above VWAP. Volume &lt;10k per minute candle. Expect a bit of sideways action for midday.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 7 10:38AM:</strong></p>
<p>Slight megaphone pattern followed by a pullback to the 140 support.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 6 10:26AM:</strong></p>
<p>Wow. Rally to 145. Around 100k volume per minute candle. Somebody bought a ton.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 5 10:08AM:</strong></p>
<p>Couple Puts bought around 135 strike. Nothing major.</p>
<img src="img/gbmv4lce7ys61.png"/>
<p><strong>Edit 4 9:58AM:</strong></p>
<p>Slight bounce around 132.</p>
<p>Notice the slope of the stock and OBV has decreased. This is a bullish sign imo.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3 9:37AM:</strong></p>
<p>At this rate, we may even reach the 132.5 support.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2 9:31AM:</strong></p>
<p>181k volume first minute candle on Webull. Another low volume day?</p>
<p><strong>Edit 1 9:28AM:</strong></p>
<p>Possible bounce around 9:50AM at 138 support.</p>

<p>Gooooooood morning my space astronauts!</p>
<p>So... McDonald's day is 4-15.</p>

<p>Guess I won't mind waiting two days to, cough*, celebrate McDonald's day.</p>
<p>Anyways, I don't find it surprising that Sherman got the boot. The Activist Takeover is going just as planned. The transformation will take time. Those DTCC rules being fully implemented will also take time. But patience is often rewarded.</p>

<h1>Premarket Analysis</h1>
<p>Net sideways in the premarket. Nothing too interesting.</p>

<p>Yesterday's volatility brought IV up a tad. Nothing too crazy though.</p>
