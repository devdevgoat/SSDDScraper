<content><p>Actual post is below under the line, here is a long edit in response to FUD-packers.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thank you SO much for response, i am overwhelmed and titjacked from your feedback! Thanks!</p>
<p>In response to some FUDPOSTERS arguing to the point that this is not an official SEC communication. Well duh. The first line in this post is clearly saying whats up: "<strong><em>its a speech published on SEC website</em></strong>". The speech partially describes what SEC is up to, like LIBOR-stuff and the coming meme-stock report. Partially it describes the opinions of its author, a commissioner with longstanding SEC-involvements, and her take on the direction of the coming official SEC-report. As a very knowledgeable person she interprets the road ahead (e.g. phrases like "...looking forward to a road that is likely to be rich with regulatory change..." etc). Further, my post is, very obviously, an interpretation (but with direct quotes provided as substantiation for my interpretations), even as the speech itself contains many interpretations and opinions. </p>
<p><strong><em>IMPORTANT:</em></strong>Nevertheless, this is NOT JUST OPINIONS. Its on the SEC website, clearly showing that:</p>
<p>A) SEC WILL PUBLISH A "MEME-STOCK REPORT". </p>
<p>B) Further, it shows that the <strong><em>PROCESS IS ALREADY UNDERWAY, and she gives a taste of what we WILL see in the OFFICIAL SEC REPORT</em></strong>. For example: "The staff is working on a report about the events related to meme stock trading... As usual, commentators have gotten a head start and have <strong><em>identified a number of regulatory responses</em></strong>, including possible regulation of family offices and enhanced disclosure requirements for synthetic stock positions created through the use of total return swaps and possibly other derivative instruments.</p>
<p>C) Get a load of this. No one is talking about "possible regulations", or "this may happen". The language on the current status of the memestock report is like this: "commentators have... identified a number of regulatory responses". There are NO conditional phrases here. They have fucking identified regulatory responses.</p>
<p>Dont let these FUDposters steal the joy here, saying these are just loose remarks unassociated with SEC. <strong><em>THIS IS FALSE</em></strong>. In this way, SEC coming report and ITS ANGLE IS LEAKED: A) SHORTS ARE THE BAD GUYS and B) THERE WILL BE REGULATIONS.</p>
<p><strong><em>TLDR: SEC IS WORKING ON MEMESTOCK RELATED REPORT THAT IDENTIFY PRACTICES OF ILLICIT SHORTING  IN RELATION TO SAID MEMESTOCKS, AS WELL AS REGULATORY RESPONSES. THIS IS RIGHT IN THE SPEECH ALREADY 28 APRIL.</em></strong></p>
<p>We have been waiting for this FOR AGES. And now WHEN IT IS OUT IN THE OPEN, YOU FUD? By all means, give counter-DD or whatever, but 90% off this shit below is straightup FUD. Get this OUT. Open fucking Champagne. We now <strong><em>KNOW</em></strong> SEC has eyes on this, and even that regulatory responses are in the works. ALSO BTW FUCK KENNY AND HIS FRIENDS TYVM.</p>

<p><strong><em>TLDR</em></strong>
On April 28th, the SEC website published a speech that has NOT recieved its due attention from apes. This is a very strong and direct piece, even calling short hedgies "werewolves", and i think by this piece they want to get our attention.
This speech delineates, among other things, the parameters of a coming SEC report related to "meme stocks". The speech is way out of SEC historical comfort zone, and it goes to show that they see our frustration. Otherwise it wouldn't have been this strong. It is not written in typical SEC-speak either, it is written in the most simple and easily understand (yet precise and legally prudent) way it possibly can. For me, it is very clear that they want to say something like this: "Meme-stock holders (i dont like this designator either, but nevertheless, it is very clear what they mean): we see your frustration. We have our eyes on this. Here is our position: </p>
<p>a) there ARE SHORTIE FUCKERIES related to e.g. GME stocks. </p>
<p>b) SEC will address it with regulations, that are ALREADY IDENTIFIED.</p>
<p>c) SEC should NOT give a fuck about hedge/financial institution loosing ALOT of money. </p>
<p>d) Bonus: LIBOR is fucking done for. [GET A LOAD OF THIS!]</p>

<p>Fellow Apes, I come before you in [GG-speak] these "important times". On April 28th, the SEC website published a speech that has NOT recieved its due attention from apes. This is a very strong and direct piece, even calling short hedgies "werewolves", and i think by this piece they want to get our attention. Before i give just five very important quotes from this piece, here is the link: 
https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/werewolves-of-change</p>
<p><strong><em>Summary</em></strong>
The SEC will issue an entire report focused on: "the events related to meme stock trading". Expected to follow from this: "regulatory initiatives". This is again repeated: "regulatory changes might be appropriate". So what problems do they identify? Get this: "enhanced disclosure requirements for synthetic stock positions created through the use of total return swaps and possibly other derivative instruments". Fffuuuuu....</p>
<p>Best part is this though: "The staff is working on a report about the events related to meme stock trading... As usual, commentators have gotten a head start and have identified a number of regulatory responses...". Read that again, now pop that champagen [Futurama-spelling, you wouldnt get it].</p>
<p>Here is an item of worry in the piece: "Let us carry out the necessary analyses to determine whether there is a problem that market participants cannot resolve on their own." This reeks of intervention, so they are being open with this reality in that the domain of "meme stock" fuckeries may be under SEC formal disciplinary responsibility. And that is true. However, they the author counters the inverventionist implications by saying, DIRECTLY afterwards: "Preventing family offices [A hedgefund, Archegos, being given as one example] from losing their fortunes is not in the category of problems that the SEC needs to step in to solve. Similarly, the mere fact that trading desks at some financial institutions lost a lot of money should not cause us a great deal of concern as long as their activity was consistent with our rules".</p>
<p>Alot happens here. First, the author is explicitly saying they couldnt care less about HEDGEFUNDS LOOSING MONEY. Realize author is in no way obligated to be this clear. Furthermore, she even took the care to specify what we are talking about more precisely: "A LOT of money". SEC shouldnt care. And it gets even fucking more badass, get this: "such events ["financial institutions loosing A LOT OF money"] inevitably serve as LESSONS for risk managers". Can you imagine ONE single way of for how SEC-commisioner may [in a legally prudent way] write the piece more offensively to hedgefunds? I cant.</p>
<p>It ends on a note invoking the analogy of werewolves. I have never come across this in ANY official communication. Werewolves are predators having two shapes; one acceptable, and simultaneously underneath, another shape being evil and destructive. This is extremely strong language. Author is identifying a "bad guy", THIS PRIOR TO THE ACTUAL REPORT EVEN BEING ISSUED. And it is clear (above) that this is the angle the report will take. Author has given, without actually naming them now, an unmistakable description of who they are. And it is not apes. Apes and other retail GME fanbois can be called alot of things, but NOT werewolves. Apes have been clear from day one with the intentions, and however you morally assess ape prospectives of MOASS and shit, Apes are NOT twofaced. But this is the one feature that sets out werewolves. So who then are the enemies, if it is not the retail-side of "meme stocks"? You know it. Hey Kenny......</p>
<p><strong><em>My proposal:</em></strong> I realize 99% here are now on the Musk train of thinking SEC are shitheads. They probably are, or at any rate, have been. But lets realize that if they are 100% crooks and suits, they wouldn't want to regulate meme stock shorting. Yet here we fucking are (IN YOUR FACE sHFs)! Lets give them ONE chance. Lets hold, and let them issue the report describing their take on "meme stocks". If they fuck it up, fucking egg all of them and get pitchforks. But for now, they are stretching out a hand - lets hear them out. Who the fuck would have imagined a month ago that SEC would host fucking Harry Potter level dramatury FUCK HF-publications like this? This is unprecedented. It appears to show that GG is more ready to fuck shit up than we are, and thats saying alot given how much we all long for taking a good long shit on sHFs. He has been waiting for over a decade for his comeback. Allow him ONE chance. Lets give him, at least passively, our support until them. He is a POLITICIAN and while he has technically room to manouver, diplomatically he is also limited by the public sentiment. Lets show him that, to expand his room ALOT. Lets show him: we too, think sHFs should get a "lesson". We too, want werewolves to be called out. We too, want avg joes to get just a FAIR CHANCE. Let him ride on an everflowing tide, in every communication platform, on these exact sentiments. It will make his job of actually doing the FUCKING, much, much easier. Thanks.</p>
<p>Anyhow, floor raised +50%. Enjoy a couple of extra Lambo garages.</p>
<p>My only wish as a compensation for taking the time to write this piece, is that the forthcoming SEC report will be referred to as "Hedgefunds Bane". I also want a LOTR-related tag and some kind of milkshake. Thank you.</p></content></body>
