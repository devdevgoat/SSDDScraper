<p>He says it is never glowing this late. He thought it was strange even before i called him!</p>
<p>I found the hotel using Google Maps cuz i went on a hunt for an ape friendly eye-witness confirmation that could confirm whether this is typical.  “This is STRANGE!” he said. “The building never glows this late. It is glowing.”  He was a foreigner. These were his words. </p>
<p>Unbelievable!</p></content></body>
