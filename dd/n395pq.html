<content><p>Dear Apes</p>
<p>I am watching a documentary on Amazon Prime called "The Inside Job". I have not finished watching it, I just stopped it to run over to my laptop and check something.</p>
<p>In that documentary, the reason banks were able to do all sorts of wacky bullshit - First selling  <strong>collateralized debt obligations</strong> (CDOs), which were all the bad mortgages packaged into a high quality McHappy Meal, then later betting against CDOs - was because of essentially bribing regulatory bodies to give them a high rating.</p>
<p>In the movie the big short, this is the part where they go to the lady who "Is blind to the actions of wall street" and also "Can't see because of her eye problem". This is the part where Steve Carrel talks to her and starts shitting his pants.</p>
<p>So in order for these shitty mortgages to get good ratings, Banks bribed/paid/made deals with  <strong>Standard &amp; Poor's Global Ratings</strong>, <strong>Moody's</strong>, and <strong>Fitch Ratings</strong>.</p>
<p>As soon as the bribery got put into play to get higher ratings, these agencies saw an increase in profit.</p>
<p>So, I stopped the documentary, ran to my computer, and loaded up the old google.</p>
<p>You're Welcome.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/T2IaJwkqgPk?t=3322">https://youtu.be/T2IaJwkqgPk?t=3322</a><a href="https://youtu.be/T2IaJwkqgPk?t=3322"> (wb)</a></p>

<p>As you can see in the above graphic... Something happened in late January that caused the price of Moody's and S&amp;P Global rating agencies, to suddenly start trending upwards. They were down 10% and then from Late January, suddenly saw an increase of performance of about 25%.</p>
<p>I could not find Fitch for comparisons</p>
<p>So if I invested $1000 into Moody's or S&amp;P, I'd have made back at least $200 (20%). What was the best date to guarantee that bottom investment that would continue to climb? What date was the bottom of the rating agency dip?</p>
<p>January 28th, 2021 - Spike day.</p>
<p>Now, lets look back as this is just year to date.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="img/8mshl6d99qw61.png"/></p>
<p>Something is up.</p>
<p>The new above graph is a zoomed out picture. You can see that the rating agencies had this hill that was coming down. Then, Jan 28th and the initial squeeze that was RH halted. Suddenly, Rating Agencies became super sexy and the stock went up 20%-25%.</p>
<p>Coincidence? I think not! I think smarter apes need to look into this. Maybe there is another factor in play. Biden, Politics, The Economy...</p>
<p>But what if Robinhood was put under pressure by EVERYONE on Wall Street and we really put their dick in a blender that day, but didn't know about it? What if they have been having late night meetings since late January? What if they are now bribing and doing everything needed to get good ratings on investment products that are super toxic, but matured in toxicity too fast thanks to our squeeze?</p>
<p>TL;DR - Smarter apes need to look over the data. Smoother Apes - Need to watch "Inside Job" on Prime and notice that during the 2008 recession, banks bribed rating agencies and those agencies saw a rise in stock. Same shit is happening again. BULLISH.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Part 2... Basically... LOL</p>
<p>Edit: I added more thoughts and made this thing longer. Yikes!</p>
<p>I am no u/Rensole, I am no  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/atobitt/">u/atobitt</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/atobitt/"> (wb)</a>, I am no genius ape. I think those guys need to look into this, and using their bigger brains, connect any dots, if there are any.</p>
<p>Basically I am suggesting that ratings agencies are seeing an increase in business/profit because our hedge fund friends are paying them handsomely for good ratings. That's how rating agencies made billions in the 2008 crash.</p>
<p>Why would rating agencies need to be bribed/bought off? What is the underlying asset that is worthless, which requires going to an agency and paying them for a better rating? I sent them an email and we'll see what they say in response. Just asked what's popular right now. What the hot new thing is.</p>
<p>I think this has less to do with Hedge Funds and more to do with banks. Specifically bankers. Hedge Funds are a group of investors that pool their money together, and ideally make returns on their investment, by long/shorting the market (among other things). Basically that's a Hedge Fund. Bankers, specifically investment bankers make lots of money. In 2008, Investment bankers created a crisis by selling CDOs as an investment product. That later fell apart because of sub prime lending. With those delicious tendies, they bought nice stuff, sure. But your local bank only insures X amount. In Canada, a bank insures only $250,000 max. You need to put your money somewhere safe. So you invest in the market. You buy individual stocks, sure. But you also invest in hedge funds. Which Hedge Fund would you invest in? The best, right? Who is the best out there... Citadel. Citadel has the best reputation in the financial community.</p>
<p>So you're a rich banker, maybe even CEO of a bank. You give your money to the guy with the most expensive apartment in New York City. He knows what he's doing, he's so rich, he lives on Park Ave.</p>
<p>You're not just a lonely rich banker, you have a community. Globally. These are the guys staying up late at night on the weekends. What is going on, that all these people are up all night on the weekend?</p>
<p>The purpose of a ratings agency is to assign - what is believed to be an audit - of a corporation's or government's debt. So Canada got downgraded last year by Fitch from AAA to AA+. A ratings agency would be needed for rating bonds. Who is offering bonds? Lots of corporations! Bank of America, JP Morgan, Goldman Sacks, Citadel did $666m bonds.</p>
<p>You know who also sold some bonds recently? Donald Trump. 1/3 of his portfolio is a 30% stake in a CMBS - Commerical Morgage Backed Securities - with Vornado. Vornado did some re-financing, and that meant a windfall of $600m for Trump ($1.2B all together) his CMBS is rated AAA.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/trump-scores-617-million-of-cash-with-vornado-from-tower-bonds-1.1597650">https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/trump-scores-617-million-of-cash-with-vornado-from-tower-bonds-1.1597650</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210503142557/https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/trump-scores-617-million-of-cash-with-vornado-from-tower-bonds-1.1597650"> (wb)</a></p>
<p>So my smooth ape brain understands that that bonds and MBS/CMBS are rated by corporations like Moody's. I understand that banks issued bonds. I understand that even Trump is issuing bonds on his CMBS. I understand in 2008 the bad CDOs that banks sold to people, were known to the banks and that's why the banks bet against themselves. In that same spirit, the banks are aware of what is going on, that we do not know as the public. They're up all night on the weekends. Possibly paying to have higher ratings on certain products.</p>
<p>Is everyone gathering liquidity for a massive purchasing of assets, once a market collapse occurs?</p>
<p>Imagine you're a bank. You know shit is going to hit the fan, your business is going to take a big hit. What do you do before that happens? What all CEO cowards do, sell! One investment banker during the great recession of 2008, made half a billion in the 12 months leading to the market crash, by selling his stock in the company. So we sell. Do we sell as an individual? Or... Do we try to get more money? I would absolutely - knowing that shit is going to hit the fan - sell bonds in my business in large enough volumes. Investors and others buy those bonds. I need a good rating, and bribe Moody's instead of letting them look through my books. Now the business has liquidity, cash. Investors, have a piece of paper probably worth nothing soon. All their money is in my pocket. What do I do with that money? You'd think bonuses, but JP Morgan froze raises and bonuses were lower for Bank of America.</p>

<p>So banks offer bonds... Need Liquidity... Freeze pay in some cases... Bonuses are meh... Rating Agencies have higher earnings...</p>
<p>Maybe the question is leverage.</p>
<p>During the 2008 recession and the lead up to it, investment banks had high leverage. So for every $1, they have $15 leveraged against it. So if they had $2, they now actually had $30. But if they lost $1, then that leverage is $15 and $15 is wiped off the books.</p>
<p><strong>OKAY. I think I got it...</strong> <strong><em>Leverage ratio</em></strong> <strong>is part of the equation</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/T2IaJwkqgPk?t=2139">https://youtu.be/T2IaJwkqgPk?t=2139</a><a href="https://youtu.be/T2IaJwkqgPk?t=2139"> (wb)</a></p>
<p>Follow me into the rabbit hole for a moment...</p>
<p>Bank of America currently has a leverage ratio of 9.84. This means that for every dollar BoA has, it has borrowed 9.84. Borrowed Money vs Bank Money.</p>
<p><a href="https://csimarket.com/stocks/singleFinancialStrength.php?code=BAC&amp;Le">https://csimarket.com/stocks/singleFinancialStrength.php?code=BAC&amp;Le</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210503142601/https://csimarket.com/stocks/singleFinancialStrength.php?code=BAC&amp;Le"> (wb)</a></p>
<p>The Pandemic allowed Banks to borrow more, though this example of the SLR or Supplementary Leverage Ratio that banks need to follow post 2008 crisis. Any ways, the government offered SLR relief, allowing banks to increase their leverage. They can borrow more money.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/banks-press-fed-to-preserve-600-billion-in-balance-sheet-leeway">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/banks-press-fed-to-preserve-600-billion-in-balance-sheet-leeway</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210421093306/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/banks-press-fed-to-preserve-600-billion-in-balance-sheet-leeway"> (wb)</a></p>
<p>The idea is that if a bank is over leveraged, it will collapse. So according to the documentary, the SEC was lobbied to "raise the roof" and borrowing increased to buy loans etc etc in 2008. More loans meant more CDOs back then. More loans now, means... ???</p>
<p>It's pretty simple... If Bank of America, is only allowed to have a limit of X... Lets say the ratio cannot exceed 10... They're at 9.84... If they take on more leverage... They cross into that 10 number ratio area... But.... If they sell bonds.... If they add $15 billion to their assets... In theory... Their roof is increased by another... $147,600,000,000 or so?</p>
<p>Bank of America made Net $17b in 2020. Raising $15b is like doubling their net revenue for 2020.</p>

<p>So on the surface... $15 billion doesn't sound like a lot for Bank of America. Big bank raising liquidity. Yup. They're raising it, to allow themselves to borrow more money. Why would they need to borrow more money? <strong>MOASS</strong></p>
<p>You'd need to keep Moody's happy as things unfolded. Pay them to not change your ratings. Sort of like how for $10,000 you can eliminate all negative Yelp reviews on your restaurant.  The banks are all in the same boat.</p>
<p>Bank of America after offering $15b, can now buy $147b in loans. They increased their leverage. All these banks offering bonds did so.</p>
<p>I'd like to see smarter apes look into Rating Agencies and Leverage Ratios. I think something might be there.  </p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong>  I just want to add that causation does not equal correlation. Eating Ice Cream in America does not kill Indian people in India in the summer. Just because you can link two things to an event, doesn't mean they are connected. Heat in summer increases sales of ice cream in America, and heat in India leads to many more cases of heat exhaustion than normal. </p>
<p>In that same spirit, we <strong>cannot</strong> truly draw anything from this DD. The only way we can draw anything from this observation, is by having smarter apes look into it. It could be an indicator, or it could be coincidence. Maybe we need more data later down the road. Perhaps in hindsight in future, when all the facts are out, this could have been something - or nothing. </p></content></body>
