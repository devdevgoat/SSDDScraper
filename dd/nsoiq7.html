<content><p>I found <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-securities-hires-ex-sec-director-luparello-as-general-counsel-1491323109">this article from 2017 about Citadel hiring an ex-SEC director</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210605131523/https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-securities-hires-ex-sec-director-luparello-as-general-counsel-1491323109"> (wb)</a>.</p>
<p>I found it because I saw a fellow ape say "if the SEC knew about this shit and did nothing, then the market is fooked." </p>
<p>And I thought, "hmm, how do I explain to this ape that of course they know. How? For instance, a ton of them work on Wall Street. Oh! I know. I'll search to see if anyone from the SEC works at Citadel." And guess what, apes? The ex fucking SEC director works for Citadel as their "general counselor."</p>
<p>Oh, wow, Stephen. What kind of counselor are you? Are you the kind of counselor that talks to Ken about <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2009/11/hedge-funder_ken_griffin_has_t.html">the trauma of not getting his favorite ice cream in 2008 after he lost $8 billion fucking all of us over</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210417233707/https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2009/11/hedge-funder_ken_griffin_has_t.html"> (wb)</a>? Or do your cuddle him and whisper in his 🌈🐻 ear "That'll do, Kenneth. That'll do" while giving him workplace appropriate bums pats because of that one time <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6c613f92-cf35-4b2e-b2b0-2ac0a6afb1fb">RC nuked his crime empire with a tweet of the very ice cream he'd previously been denied by his own irresponsible fuckery</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210418172321/https://www.ft.com/content/6c613f92-cf35-4b2e-b2b0-2ac0a6afb1fb"> (wb)</a>. Or did you try to <a href="https://youtu.be/5_f2AEiHY8w">help him stop his eyes getting so damned freaky when he cheats at UNO on Citadel official YouTube</a><a href="https://youtu.be/5_f2AEiHY8w"> (wb)</a>? You were there when Citadel released that video, and you were counseling them, Stephen. I'd like to know.</p>
<p>Just wow. An ex-SEC Director helping design and direct market fraud after do nothing to stop it when stopping it is what we paid him and trusted him to do. And here's the kind of bullshit media FUD that trains us to avoid asking questions or recognize the game; from the article about Stephen's hiring at Citadel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the country’s most prominent stock-market regulators has finally switched sides, opting to join Citadel Securities, one of the largest trading firms in the country.
Stephen Luparello will join Citadel Securities as its general counsel in May...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is this FUD, you ask? He didn't switch sides! Obviously! He let Citadel fuck us so hard they gave him a 🌈🐻 parachute for his help to do it some more! Language designed to give us the impression that he actually regulated the market in a way that was opposed to the interests of Wall Street and, therefore, aligned with our interests. Smh.</p>
<p>Here's what I'm getting at:</p>
<p>We, as a people, let Stephen Luparello be fucking terrible at his job. That let's these hedge fund assholes fuck the whole world. And it is actually our responsibility as citizens because these are government employees who represent us to the world. And we can force the firing of these motherfuckers. In fact, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ohr/sec-compensation">here's the SEC payscale that shows an approximation of how much we paid Stephen to help people like Ken Griffen fuck us over</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210424105508/https://www.sec.gov/ohr/sec-compensation"> (wb)</a>. And, again, how good was Stephen at helping Ken Griffin fuck us??? So good at helping Ken fuck us that Ken asked Stephen, with eyes as intense as 1000 suns and 3000 times creepier, "can I hire you to help me do this even better as my company's General Counselor?" </p>
<p>And shorting the bond market? Well... <a href="https://www.citadel.com/news/dr-ben-bernanke-serve-senior-advisor-citadel/">Citadel hired Ben Bernanke, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, in 2015</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210522211717/https://www.citadel.com/news/dr-ben-bernanke-serve-senior-advisor-citadel/"> (wb)</a> to be their Senior Advisor. Here's an article literally titled <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MB-39960">"Ben Bernanke Bends the Bond Market to His Iron Will"</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210605052823/https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MB-39960"> (wb)</a>. And now they might have shorted the bond market more than 100%...</p>
<p>What a scam. </p>
<p>A lot of you probably already know this wrinkle to the corruption saga, and I'm made of tinfoil and expect this shit, but something about this caught me off guard tonight. I don't know why this particular piece of information made me stop and think, <em>no. This shit is no longer acceptable.</em></p>
<p>Regardless, you have a job to do Gary Gensler. We can all see hedgies <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/interactive-brokers-founder-says-problem-with-amc-entertainment-memes-peoplewill-lose-a-very-substantial-amount-of-money-11622836260">fucking with meme stocks other than GameStop to scare retail from riding the GameStop MOASS rocket as high as it should go when we start to moon with an orchestrated pump and dump</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210605135342/https://www.marketwatch.com/story/interactive-brokers-founder-says-problem-with-amc-entertainment-memes-peoplewill-lose-a-very-substantial-amount-of-money-11622836260"> (wb)</a>. So ether do your fucking job, give us 5 exaggerated blinks in a row at your next press conference if you're worried big money will kill you if you do your job, or gtfo. We caught hedgies fair and square. Through all the FUD, all the learning, and time that has passed getting to this point, remember that apes. We caught a bunch of motherfuckers in a bad yolo meant to destroy something we care about.</p>
