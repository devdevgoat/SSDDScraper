<p>The price you see on your broker is the average price between the bid and the ask. The bid is set by the buyers and the ask is set by the sellers. The market makers (Shitadel and others) make their money on the difference. The more liquid a security (which GME isn't at all, hence the extremely low volume and blatant manipulation) the tighter the spread between the Bid and the Ask. Below is an example of GME's spread from today. </p>

<p>When you go to sell on Robinhood and other "user friendly" brokers, the order type you're executing by default is a market order. If you sell a market order it will fill at the BID price, NOT the price you see in your watchlist. This usually doesn't matter as much if you don't care about the pennies, but when this blows and GME is trading at $1,000,000, who knows what the spread will be. It wouldn't be unrealistic to think the Ask could be $1,020,000 and the Bid as $980,000 which would look like the price is trading at $1,000,000. When the hedge funds get margin called, they are placing huge market buy orders which fill on the ask. Why would you sell at the Bid when you know these criminals have to buy on the Ask? Selling using a market order will not hinder the squeeze, but it will eat at some of your potential gains; and I don't know about you but I am sucking these motherfuckers dry.</p>
