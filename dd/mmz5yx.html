<content><p><strong>EDIT 3: THIS SHOULD BE TAKEN AS GOOD NEWS!!!</strong></p>
<p>The initial concern was that GameStop sold a bunch of bonds that have the option to convert into shares of common stock.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>This means an owner of GameStop's bond can convert (under certain circumstances) into shares of GME to cover a large short position, without being traded on the market.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>I have been informed by a few people that they <strong>do not have a currently have CONVERTIBLE BONDS</strong></p>
<p>This would have been a VERY VERY SNEAKY way for short sellers to cover their asses without us knowing from the stock market.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Thank you to u/the_captain_slog for digging into this!</p>

<p>ORIGINAL POST </p>
<p>Can't believe I didn't think of this sooner....</p>
<p>u/the_captain_slog any help here? Know anything off the top of your head?</p>
<p>A <strong>convertible bond</strong> is a fixed-income corporate <strong>debt</strong> security that yields interest payments, but can be converted into a predetermined number of common stock or equity shares. The conversion from the <strong>bond</strong> to stock can be done at certain times during the <strong>bond's</strong> life and is usually at the discretion of the bondholder.</p>
<p>Anyone know a thing or two about the corporate bond market? Can we objectively calculate this exposure?</p>

<h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Convertible bonds are corporate bonds that can be exchanged for common stock in the issuing company.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Companies issue convertible bonds to lower the coupon rate on debt and to delay dilution.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A bond's conversion ratio determines how many shares an investor will get for it.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Companies can force conversion of the bonds if the stock price is higher than if the bond were to be redeemed.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I know BlackRock is buying a sh*t lod of corporate bonds because I incorrectly stated they were buying TBonds. Could literally mean a HUGE margin call through BlackRock when they convert those bonds.</p>
<p>Wonder how many of those are convertible?</p>
<p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>EDIT 1: Or BlackRock and other bond holders could be converting them into shares and paying the HFs back. But they would be doing it outside of the market.</p>
<p>Q: Wondering if these are the "blips" we see in AH trading?</p>
