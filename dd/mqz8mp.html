<content><p><strong>Important - See edit 2 at bottom of my write up.</strong></p>
<p>A lot of calls have been added this week on top of what was already the most stacked options week for GME by far. There are no other weeks on the board that are even close to this week. The closest, in July is barely half by volume.</p>
<p>I'll give the quick rundown on calls for the smooth brained and new apes to make sure you understand. A call is an option that gives you the right to buy 100 shares at whatever the strike price is. If your call finishes ITM (In The Money) you can either exercise the call - what DFV is about to do, or sell to close at the delta between the strike call and the value of the shares. For example, we're sitting at about $160 right now, so a $150 call would be ITM for about $10 per share, or $1000.</p>
<p>The important part to understand with calls is that the call sellers hedge those calls (or at least they're supposed to). What a lot of people don't understand is how that process works. The call seller(MM, or Market Maker) basically just uses the Delta of the call to determine how many shares they should buy to hedge. Delta is expressed in decimal figures. So, if the Delta is .50 the MM would hedge with 50 shares out of the 100 that are at risk if the call goes ITM. If a call is already deep ITM the Delta would be 1, so they should have the total 100 shares on hand.</p>
<p>I pulled these when I started writing, they are from around 2:15 pm central time on 4/14.</p>

<p>If you notice above, the Delta for a 150 call is at .67. So, the MM should have 67 shares on hand at this moment to hedge. They still need to buy 33 to cover completely. But look at the $250 call. It's only at a .09. That means if that call finishes ITM the MM still needs to buy 91 shares. On most stocks the odds of the price rising that rapidly is almost none, but this is MF GME! We know how GME rolls. We may stay flat for a while then have a crazy bounce all at once. The price action today has me thinking we MIGHT be in for a treat. So anyhow, if the price starts rapidly rising those Delta numbers all rise in correlation with it. All the sudden, the MMs are scrambling trying to hedge to where the Delta tells them they should be. All this does is cause the price to rise further, raising the Delta all the way up the chain. This, my smoothbrained friends is the Gamma squeeze. Now to the fun part.</p>

<p>This is the option chain for GME. It doesn't list all of the call strikes because there are a shitload, but it does hit the major strikes. It also has a running total at each price, and the sum total at $800. Yes, that's right. There are 165,168 calls this week! There are 32,468 calls ITM right now. That represents 3,246,800 shares. The deep ITM calls should be 100% hedged, everything above $140 is about 80% hedged on average. The MMs need to buy some shares, but not a ton.</p>
<p>However, what if we crank this price up to $300? At $170 the Delta is .37, so they should have 37 shares on hand per call. At $300 the Delta is only .058, so we'll call it 6 shares per call. I'm not doing all the maths, so we'll just average and say they need to buy just under 80 shares per call on average to hedge if these strikes go ITM. There are 39176 calls between $170 and $300. That's just under 3.1 million shares they would need to buy to hedge between $170 and $300, plus everything still needed to hedge below that, maybe an extra million.</p>
<p>This is where it gets terrifying for the shorts AND the MM, if having to buy 4 million real shares on top of the regular trades, combined with FOMO from rapidly rising prices kicks this thing into high gear, there are an additional 87,285 calls between $300 and $800. Most of which haven't been hedged at all, they're just too far OTM. That would add over 8 million shares to the 4 they already bought. That's over 12 million shares. That's over 25% of the float. And we already own the float...</p>
<p>I'm not trying to get everyone too amped up. It happens when it happens so don't be disappointed if it isn't this week. All I'm saying is if a few big investors gave this thing a little nudge, and other people caught the FOMO, the next two days could be the start of what we've all been waiting for.</p>
<p>TL;DR The hedgies could be screwed with a little more pressure, but you really should read the whole thing.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all of the awards fellow apes!  Really appreciate it and I hope this was helpful to at least show you how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:  Hopefully this doesn't come off too tinfoil hat.  I'm posting this here because this post has gotten a lot of attention and I want people to see this.  I just read some other DD that talked about SI (Short Interest) rising dramatically across the broad markets.  No idea if this is correct, if someone could verify that would be great.  Anyhow, this caused a wrinkle in my brain to twitch.  I have CNBC on in my office most days, and Jim Cramer was talking all day today about how great the big banks are doing and what a great buy they are.  Wouldn't shut up about them.  Now, anyone who has invested in stocks that Cramer pumps knows that they have a bad habit of losing money in the following days.  It has happened to me.  I've looked into it and found several writeups about how Cramer is still connected to a bunch of the Short Sellers and he pumps up stock for them, then they short at the peak he has created to make a fortune.  What if today was a setup for them to short the big banks???  What do they know?  I have no information whatsoever that this is happening, but holy shit that wrinkle is still quivering.  Again, sorry if that is too far out there for some of you, it just felt really important to me.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit 3:  A lot of you have been asking some really good questions about options.  Since everyone is so fired up I thought I'd share another post that I wrote about a separate possible issue the MMs might have with hedging.  Feel free to check it out if you want.</strong></p>
