<content><p><strong>Update 1st June 2021:</strong></p>
<p>RIP to my inbox, however I managed to go through all messages and updated my table accordingly, main changes listed here:</p>
<p>-&gt; (New) T212 total shareholders available</p>
<p>-&gt; (Updated) eToro numbers. Apparently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/npc9n7/when_you_purchase_gme_on_etoro_it_states_that/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">96k GME investors</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210531201502/https://i.redd.it/c5sbf77bki271.jpg"> (wb)</a> on eToro !</p>
<p>-&gt; (Updated) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nm2ts4/52584_unvotable_shares_held_by_aussie_apearoos_in/">Selfwealth</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210527082802/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nm2ts4/52584_unvotable_shares_held_by_aussie_apearoos_in/"> (wb)</a> total number of GME shareholder available.</p>
<p>I encourage all of you apes to go and ask your broker for data available. Shares per ape, total shares held, total shareholders, it doesn't matter. All data helps.</p>

<p>Hello fellow Apes and welcome to our third and latest episode of:</p>
<h1>'Who owns the float?!'</h1>
<p>I do not only envy the Nordics for their full viking hair and their beautiful lady apes, but apparently also for their damn hot stock brokers!  Why is that?</p>
<p>As we are entering the final stage of <em>'hedgies are fuk'</em> Nordnet as well as Avanza (both brokers from the Nordics) seem to genuinley care about their customers <em>(yea, take a slice of that, RH and all you other dirtbag brokers)</em> and published their proxy vote stats on <a href="https://twitter.com/avanzabank/status/1397874363056197633">freaking twitter</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210529210727/https://twitter.com/avanzabank/status/1397874363056197633"> (wb)</a>. I will save you the click, just see below:</p>

<p>Btw: I heard transparency is a thing in the Nordics, is it true that you can just look up your neighbours tax statements or is that just a myth?</p>
<p>However, lets look into the numbers. In my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxrdcb/updated_dd_i_did_the_math_there_is_literally_no/">last post</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxrdcb/updated_dd_i_did_the_math_there_is_literally_no/"> (wb)</a> I made some assumptions, and the by far most critical was: How many shares does the average GME investor hold? <strong>Avanza / Nordnet are answering exactly this question.</strong></p>
<p>Quick math:</p>
<p>|Broker|Total GME Apes|Total Shares held|Average Shares / Apes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|<em>Avanza</em>|<em>22,023</em>|<em>322,545</em>|<em>14.65</em>|
|<em>Nordnet</em>|<em>19,206</em>|<em>329,812</em>|<em>17.17</em>|
|<strong>Total</strong>|<strong>41,229</strong>|<strong>652,357</strong>|<strong>15.82</strong>|</p>
<p><strong>15.82 / Shares per ape. If that doesnt sound juicy, i dont know what does. And even better, it exactly matches with my assumptions from my initial post:</strong></p>

<p>Okay - with the new numbers being fresh in, lets update our sweet little table. I will narrow it to down to 15 / 17.5 / 20 shares per ape. I believe that especially our US apes hold a little more than the Nordics, just for the plain reason that GameStop is more present in the States. (it even appears that GameStop has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/dq2pkm/gamestop_is_closing_all_stores_in_the_nordic/">left the Nordic market completely</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/dq2pkm/gamestop_is_closing_all_stores_in_the_nordic/"> (wb)</a>. Any viking ape here to confirm this?).</p>
<p>Please see the updated table below:</p>
<p><img src="img/uqd99jb1pn271.png"/></p>
<p>Yep, you read that right: 173% up to 230% of remaining float seems to be in retails hand. And as you can see, my list is <strong>by far not complete</strong> (just think of all the regular banks that offer trading accounts).</p>
<p>Just some more hyping:</p>
<p><img src="img/oc72s0sh72271.png"/></p>
<p>Hold strong my fellow apes, it is the final stage we have entered ! Sorting out the last paper hands before entering lightspeed. And as always: <strong>If in doubt, zoom out</strong>:</p>

<p>Have a great weekend, see you on market open, cheers !  🚀🚀🚀</p>
