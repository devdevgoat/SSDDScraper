<p>Ending around 154.49, down 1.25%. Overall the 2nd lowest volume day since Jan. </p>
<p>Have a great weekend everyone!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 12 3:29PM:</strong></p>
<p>We're on track for being the lowest volume day (less than 4.7 million) since before the Jan spike.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 11 2:43PM:</strong></p>
<p>2 hours of low volume lmao. ZZzzzzz. Hopefully we actually get some "power" during power hour.</p>

<p>Moving up on low volume. Nothing significant happening yet.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 5 10:26AM:</strong></p>
<p>Nothing really happening so far. A couple 160 and 200 strike Calls sold. Probably sold to close or covered calls.</p>

<p>First minute candle 192k volume. Pretty low. Perhaps a quiet market open followed by a bang later in the day.</p>
<h1>Begin Reading Here</h1>
<p>Gooooooood morning my fellow apes!</p>
<p>Well the day has finally come. The great exercise day. By exercise, I mean stand up in your room and stretch your arms. Do some jumping jacks and prepare for whatever the heck GME has in store for us today.</p>

<p>We saw a bit of a pullback on Thursday, and I'm expecting Friday to be a continuation of Wednesday's mad rally. Seems DFV has been on a bit of a tweeting spree recently. Maybe he knows something is up? Getting a bit pumped for what will happen very soon? Who knows. All I know that he knows, is that he really likes the stock. So do I.</p>
<h1>Premarket Analysis</h1>
<p>Shorts really do love hammering it in the premarket. Broader market gapping up in the premarket but GME hammered down.</p>
