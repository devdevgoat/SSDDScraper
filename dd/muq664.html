<p><strong>Edit 8 4:01PM:</strong></p>
<p>Ending at 158.53, down 3.55%. Watching grass grow has been more interesting that the stock today :P. Volume is extremely, potentially we are almost ready to breakout? I certainly hope so!</p>
<p>Just a reminder that I will be taking a leave of absence for a while. I will miss you all! </p>
<p><strong>Edit 7 3:50PM:</strong></p>
<p>Slight increase in volume, but the stock isn't moving much. Edging up a bit above VWAP.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 6 3:01PM:</strong></p>
<p>Sleepy hour:</p>

<p><strong>Edit 5 1:14PM:</strong></p>
<p>Watching this stock is like watching paint dry :P</p>
<p><strong>Edit 4 11:11AM:</strong></p>
<p>Stock edging lower towards the 152.5 support.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3 10:09AM:</strong></p>
<p>Tangling below VWAP. Nothing too interesting is happening.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2 9:48AM:</strong></p>
<p>Stock is sagging down on low volume. Nothing too interesting. Possible support at 158.5.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 1 9:32AM:</strong></p>
<p>180k first minute volume. Pretty low. Seems the stock is drying up once again.</p>

<p>Gooooooood morning my fellow apes!</p>
<p>The magical date has arrived. 4/20 blaze it everyone :)</p>

<p><strong>A quick announcement about my plans.</strong> I have finals coming up very soon, so I'm beginning to cram everything I procrastinated for the past 3 months in a couple of weeks. I have not shown up to class for literally 3 months LOL. They call me the cram master ;). After today, I will be taking a leave of absence from Reddit and YouTube to prepare for my finals.</p>
<p>Should the MOASS start, I will hop back onto YouTube and stream the MOASS. I have decided I will not do a live charting style post, but rather a trading recap post at the end of the day. Between Reddit, YouTube, and managing my own position and following my exit strategy, it will be really hard to focus, so I'll just post a link to my stream on Reddit, and post daily trading recaps during the MOASS days.</p>
<p>I will miss you guys while I am gone, and I'd like everyone to know that I am as bullish as ever on this stock. Hold strong and believe in the end game, because nothing has changed!</p>

<h1>Premarket Analysis</h1>
<p>Fade up premarket. We were straight up trading like a penny stock after hours yesterday. Has liquidity dried up?</p>
