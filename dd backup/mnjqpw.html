      - 6/9 being the date and 6/9 not being the date can both be seen as FUD. In the end, no date really matters, we know what cards we hold and the MOASS will happen when it happens. Hype is fun, but so was Quadruple Witching (3/19), and Earnings (3/23).

     . We may have strict posting requirements around gain porn here in /r/superstonk, but other subs do not. Prepare yourself to see all kinds of posts of people that sold early on those subs.

    <p>
     The first battle for the HFs is to prevent the MOASS, the next will be to get you to sell early when the MOASS starts.
     <strong>
      Every single dirty trick on this list can and will be used again once the MOASS starts, and I would expect it to be spread to every single GME related sub.
