<content><p>Disclaimer: I'm a smooth brainer with a lot of time.</p>
<p>So the reason for this little DD is because of a certain find by u/PapaTheSmurf and his post</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nd39dl/srnysearca202054_need_some_wrinkles_asap/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nd39dl/srnysearca202054_need_some_wrinkles_asap/</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210608023745/https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysearca/2021/34-91901.pdf"> (wb)</a></p>
<p>The finding in question is as follows and it clicked in a couple of missing pieces to a theory I have about our secret whale.<br/>
<a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysearca/2021/34-91901.pdf">https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysearca/2021/34-91901.pdf</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210608023745/https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysearca/2021/34-91901.pdf"> (wb)</a> </p>
<p>This rule appears to provide an exemption for companies that fall under “investment companies” in obtaining shareholder permission before issuing securities that relate to acquisition of stock or assets of another company.<br/>
This is huge considering that both BlackRock and Vanguard quite literally, are major institutional shareholders (almost always number 1 and 2 in ownership) of almost every major company in America.</p>
<img src="img/pgjpu1rpzoz61.png"/>
<p>Seriously, look through Yahoo finance and look up a company and their top institutional holders. They're all BlackRock and Vanguard.<br/>
BlackRock currently has an Asset Under Management value of US$9T (9,000,000,000,000).<br/>
Vanguard has US$7.1T.<br/>
Together it’s $16.1Trillion.<br/>
The reason why I put them together is because the highest institutional holder of BlackRock shares is Vanguard.  </p>
<p>NOW.</p>
<p>This is a very important headline.<br/>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/how-larry-fink-s-blackrock-is-helping-the-fed-with-bond-buying">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/how-larry-fink-s-blackrock-is-helping-the-fed-with-bond-buying</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210508014246/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/how-larry-fink-s-blackrock-is-helping-the-fed-with-bond-buying"> (wb)</a><br/>
‘BlackRock is now the Fourth Branch of Government.’<br/>
This headline is important because it’s not really much of a metaphor. BlackRock assists, funds and even advises government entities as well central banks.   </p>
<p>That’s a stupid amount of power.<br/>
Now from here we have a motive under a certain conspiracy theory. A good video on it here:<br/>

<p>This video is where I’ve got most of the research up until this point in the DD. It’s worth a watch if you have time, seriously. It’s a lot to take in but all the information is cited, and with all the bullshit we’ve seen citadel pull it’s really not that far-fetched.</p>
<p>Back to the topic at hand. <br/>
What happens when you combine the very largest securities holders on the planet that have government ties and a sneaky rule that allows Investment companies to buy out other companies without any prior permission? See where I’m going with this?<br/>
And if this wasn't good enough, this whole GME fiasco is going to be a double whammy for our big friend BlackRock.<br/>
Since, (quoting DR. T) “Citadel doesn’t wear clothes” they’ve been keeping the prices on the stock market incredibly low, we know this. Citadel has been a leech on these two giants for many many years, and GME is the prime time to rip this leech off by its slimy ass tail.<br/>
But the juicy treat is not Citadel. It’s the DTCC.<br/>
And I mentioned this in a previous fluff post after an epiphany one sleepless night.<br/>
When Citadel is done, and the bill comes in at $64Trillion.<br/>
Not only will these megalodons have a portfolio through the fuckin roof when all of their shares come back above water with the stock market inflating again.<br/>
But they can literally buy the DTCC, piece by piece as GME shoots through the goddamn milky way.</p>
<p>Below is a very detailed step by step visual for those who still don't see where this is going.  </p>
<p><img src="img/f5lle58dzoz61.png"/></p>
<p>What this means is not only are BlackRock and Vanguard going to own the entire stock market by holding all of its physical shares.<br/>
They’re going to own every single company in it.</p>
<p>And because of this ownership rule, they’re going to own the entire western face of this planet in one swing, have total undeniable control and no one can stop them.</p>
<p>What they plan and what happens after is open for debate, my best guess is what is explained in the video I linked earlier.</p>
<p>TLDR: invest in gold or BlackRock after GME moons.</p></content></p></p></body>
