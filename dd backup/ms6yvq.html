<content><p>Labeling this DD because, aside from having to do with <em>an offer to be paid to post DD</em>, I actually performed due diligence on the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/tziYjXQ">offer</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210416165049/https://imgur.com/a/tziYjXQ"> (wb)</a>.</p>
<p>If you think those alarm posts yesterday about top posters here/YouTubers getting paid to distract apes during the MOASS was FUD, I'm here with <a href="img/imgur_ybOBrfA.jpg.gif">proof</a> it's totally fucking true. (Details edited out for privacy. More on why below...) <strong>I have now sent unedited proof of the company to mods just for public integrity so you all know I'm not making this up. ~~No I will not publicly out them right now~~ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mtc4xu/buying_influence_the_pump_and_dump_scheme_preying/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">Update 4/18</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210418124458/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mtc4xu/buying_influence_the_pump_and_dump_scheme_preying/"> (wb)</a></strong></p>

<p>Some of you may know my username from memes. Sometimes I overdose on crayons and throw up a colorful DD. Some people think I'm crazy because I've posted some kinda out there theories (I stand by every one of them). But I'm just doing my thing, posting about GME in a few main stock subs since January. Cruising around reddit being a trippy lil pink cat 🐈🍄💕 </p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks I feel the tides have changed on the battlefront. Obvious paid shill accounts with the ol' adjective-noun-number format in their username started commenting way more hateful, personal stuff on my posts. All kinds of messages that seemed like they were meant to be not too aggressive, but make me paranoid none the less. After I made a few seemingly big connections in my recent posts, my account was reported for self harm. (I am a perfectly happy and content lil kitty, don't worry 🙂). Things started getting a little spooky. I also got over <a href="http://imgur.com/a/02FrYiS">100</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210416163655/https://imgur.com/a/02FrYiS"> (wb)</a> new followers just after posting that same OP. (I'm not going to link it here because that's not what this post is about.) </p>
<p><strong>Did you hear me?!</strong> <em>Over 100 new followers in like a 2 hour time frame. After a post that got like 30 upvotes and some Q comments.</em> </p>
<p>Which brings me to why I'm posting this now. I was approached yesterday by a brand new reddit account to <em>Get paid to write posts/DDs/memes in our stock subs, but only about certain NASDAQ/NYSE/OTC/EURO companies. NOT GME</em> </p>
<p>I scheduled a phone interview yesterday afternoon because... y'know... curiosity killed the cat. And of course I (legally) documented it. I am not implying the company itself is malicious, that's not for me to decide, therefore I will not be sharing it here. I have thrown it into the void of the SEC and my local reps, along with all the other things I've shared with them. Not as a whistle-blower, because my evidence doesn't necessarily prove (or disprove) anything directly. </p>
<p>But it sure jacked my tits in the confirmation bias dept. </p>
<p>As I said, I'm not going into detail about what was discussed. But I would be paid to post DD and other content about a certain assigned company or stock and essentially, it seemed to me, to "pump" that stock in our beloved subs (ok I can actually prove that with the offer itself). It is in fact a real media company making this offer. I think they are paid to come to us top posters and try to ~~bribe~~ distract us away from talking about GME. The woman I talked to was just a rep that knew nothing of reddit or how it works, but she said their "expert team of social media analysts familiar with reddit has been watching me and chose to approach me."🤷‍♀️(Please don't out yourself here if you're among us ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ as I've tried very hard to avoid calling anyone out or accuse of anything directly.)</p>
<p>I did not give them my real name. They got a burner phone number to <a href="http://imgur.com/a/itcxxer">contact me</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210416172241/https://imgur.com/a/itcxxer"> (wb)</a>. I actually requested they just call me Pink for the phone call 🤭👑 </p>
<p><strong>I want you to know I'm certainly not taking the offer.</strong> I am not going to be paid to blow up this sub with posts about other stocks besides my precious GME. Like, I literally don't care about them. And nothing will ever pay me enough to mislead or distract my fellow apes. There is no other situation like GME, we all know that. I just got enough information from them to validate that this is a very legit offer, and now I have it. It's my own confirmation bias that all of this is legit, it's not just in our heads.  </p>
<p>GME has already changed my life. This community is literally like family even though I don't know a single 1 of you apes. I want to help, I want to support, I want to educate, I want to boost morale. Paying me to spam distractions during such a critical time?</p>
<p>Your downvote bots didn't work. </p>
<p>Your hateful, personal comment attacks didn't work. </p>
<p>Your onslaught of sudden followers didn't work. </p>
<p>Your paranoia inducing messages didn't work. </p>
<p>Your self harm report didn't work. </p>
<p>AND THROWING MONEY AT ME WON'T WORK. </p>

<p>🦍🤝💪APES TOGETHER STRONG BABY🦍 🤝💪</p>
<p><strong>STAY EVER VIGILANT MY DUDES</strong> ✌</p>
<p>🗣Shout out to my real followers I'm buying you all drinks on the Moon 💎💅💕</p>
<p>Edit: I was told on the phone that I would post in the same subs I'm already active in. So while this is an opportunity to be an "influencer", it is meant for me to post about <em>the companies that pay them, in the subs I am already established i.e.- Superstonk, WSBNew, and GME</em></p>
<p>I should also note that their company clients can directly choose my reddit profile and my "expertise/reddit presence" and hire me from a list of these "influencers". They mentioned having contact with 7 other people on "stock reddits" (lol). Idk who I didn't wanna ask 🤷‍♀️</p></content></body>
