     <strong>
      Holy Fuck.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     This is probably one of the bigger things I have figured out so far.
    </p>
    <p>
     I sifted through every Citadel Advisors LLC SEC Filing since the squeeze began (I have the spreadsheets to show it) and figured out some fucked up things (oh and I figured out who Suspecthanna is operating as - and they are doing the same thing as Shitadel).
    </p>

     Im going to blow your mind like our moms should have done to our dads instead of letting him finish in her and bringing all of us into this clown pyramid scheme we are living it.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, the data is clear with one consistency - Keenny Boi the Squeezy Boi has been calling all his trust fund friends and they have been passing ownership to Citadel AT AN ALARMING RATE.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the last 2 months alone:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Citadel has taken beneficial ownership of over 25% of the capital of 56 different SPACs
     </li>
     <li>
      Totaling over $4B in capital
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     <strong>
      AND
     </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      An average of 18% ownership of 28 corporations
     </li>
     <li>
      Totaling over $3B in capital
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Now, the SPACs are a little more crazy, but because we know that Citadel has been internalizing trades, only routing sells, and probably selling smaller positions quietly to raise capital
     <em>
      *cough* FB *cough*,
     </em>
     Ill start with the corps - but we will get to the SPACs shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, a lot of the company positions have been
     <em>
      amendments
     </em>
     to their Dec 31 filings. Now, what is weird is that shortly after these filings, large amounts of shares have been sold off onto the market.  They have become benefactors of these shares to dump onto the market
     <em>
      at market price
     </em>
     should they chose. Now, these filings are applied to both Citadel and the company that issues them. So that company has to be aware that Citadel has possession of these shares (and would have been aware the whole time if they did).
    </p>
    <p>
     So why all of a sudden is Citadel the owner of these shares? Either the company is issuing them to Citadel through the board, or Citadel is somehow getting these shares another way.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      If someone has another idea how these shares were issued for a filing fee with the SEC, let me know
     </li>
     <li>
      I am relatively certain they are coming from the board issuing new shares, because there are FOUR companies with greater than 100% ownership of the float as well. So the FINRA data would imply that additional shares were created:
      <ul>
       <li>
        STRO
       </li>
       <li>
        ZNTL
       </li>
       <li>
        AVRO
       </li>
       <li>
        ANNX
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     There are a couple other notable points with regard to these new filings:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      One company is a Colombian Company and the holding is pretty small (ACHOQ)
     </li>
     <li>
      One ownership is for a company that was acquired in January by another (PRVL)
     </li>
     <li>
      One company is no longer a company and hasn't had any share reporting since 2019 (MGEN)
     </li>
     <li>
      I find this weird that they are consolidating their books in Feb 2021 for a company that seems to have disappeared in 2019
     </li>
     <li>
      One company has a negative valuation (MLND)
     </li>
     <li>
      The shares still held a market value April 28 of &gt;$4M
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     There are some weird things going on through Citadel at the moment, and Suspecthanna is on another level with more funds being funneled to their parent company than a cute pornstar who is about to do anal for the first time.

    <p>
     Did I mention that Citadel changed legal signatories on Feb 1? Huge red flag I would think. It was also filed with one of their
     <em>
      LARGEST
     </em>
     SPAC ownership filings, tucked away and hidden. JAWS (fitting that they are the only billion dollar SPAC on the list). Oh, and the JAWS benefactor? His name appears twice on this list (it seems to be the only one).
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, this list is by no means a definitive answer to anything. But I believe we just got our first glimpse at the actual investors with Citadel, who is actually exposed at an exorbitant amount (hint: banks r fuk too), and why they are pulling cash back from shell corporations (registered in tax havens) at an alarming rate (and it isn't because they want to pay taxes all of a sudden). They
     <em>
      know
     </em>
     they are about to crash the market because of these short positions.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, can we also get anything from the names of the Executives (owners of the SPACs)? Well, Ill tell you this much - a lot went to Harvard, and a lot started businesses while they were in college (one specifically opened 15 locations right away and is now a massive conglomerate), more than most worked for 20-30 years in the financial sector at the very banks that are overleveraged on this, and some have even been knighted.
    </p>
    <p>
     We need to speculate on couple things here:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      It takes money to make money; someone would need a lot to begin with to do some of these things
     </li>
     <li>
      These were not bank loans they were suddenly able to obtain with a great business model. Someone helped pull the strings to make these capital investments happen *cough* their parents *cough*
     </li>
     <li>
      A lot of this is old money that has probably gone through a changing of the guard so to speak, meaning they came in control of it by default and just wanted it to get bigger (because fuck socialism amirite?)
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     Now, I haven't combed through the names individually. But if someone wants a glimpse at who is really pulling the strings, I would definitely think that's where you would start. Suspecthanna is the next one. And boy oh boy have they been busy. Their list is almost double Shitadels (makes sense considering their short position). That's another week or so of work that I will need to dig up so just be
     <em>
      patient.
     </em>

     Did you think that Warren Buffetts famous saying about being patient is about throwing your money in a fund and letting it grow at 2% per annum? No you fucking idiot, it's about researching where the money is going and who is making mistakes. These people have made a huge mistake, and we just have to be patient. No more expecting this shit to moon tomorrow. These people will do anything at this point it seems to make sure the peasants don't get their tendies. And if you want tendies, you just have to continue to wait and let them liquidate their assets and bring it all back from off-shore. It will mean we don't need a bailout and our tendies will be glorious. We can even flush the governments with cash to make a difference and not work for rich people only. But that is it. Just fucking wait.

    <p>
     To note, this is not investment advice, and it is all publicly available information so I have not gone out of my way to find these benefactors.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh and Suspecthanna? I haven't seen ANYONE asking about
     <strong>
      DIMENSIONAL FUND ADVISORS LP.
     </strong>
     You're welcome.
