      Only edit:
     </strong>
     some of you have been linking me to posts saying that my prediction was just a day early. At first, I didn't think it could be true but now I think there might be some credence because we closed at .01% today and that has only happened 2 other times (went up big the next day). Nevertheless, lets sit back and watch what happens tomorrow. Even if we bounce up tomorrow, as my DD has stated, THIS IS NOT GME MOON DAY, there will be more to cum. If nothing happens this week, I will be making a huge FTD DD in the coming days/weeks. If we pop up this week, I will be making a huge FTD DD in the coming days/weeks. Gonna stay quiet for a few days probably and will be back to you soon with more information. Stay strong, apes.

     Apes, I come to as a humbled primate but not a dead gorilla. As many of you know, it seems that my prediction will not be panning out as I thought it would. Summary of my theory:
    </p>

    <p>
     However, with this, I have learned a great deal of information about GME and its price history. I've had many chats with fellow apes about FTDs, past price data, volume, etc. and I think that we are all learning a great deal of information from each other. As many of you know, my theory was simply based on the price and volume of GME. After making that prediction, many people pointed out other patterns relating to FTDs and monthly option expiries (see the bottom of my most recent post for that). After looking into it, I think that there is really something there; however, it is going to take A LOT of digging. It will not just take one ape, it will take many apes. This will not be easy. Compared to everything else in finance and investing, FTD theory/explanations/data are sparse, so this will be a herculean endeavor. Also, I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has interacted with posts. Whether you gave me an award, gave me an upvote, commented something nice, or called me retarded, I absolutely love doing these DDs and your responses make it worth it!

     Where are we going?

    <p>
     Some of you have said that there are signs that tomorrow could actually be what I thought would happen today. Though I'd love this, don't get your hopes up. What I've learned from today is that price and volume alone cannot help predict the price of GME. Is this because GME is manipulated or stupid? Who knows. However, I think that if we do an asinine amount of digging and truly understand FTDs, we can get to the bottom of why GME spikes up and down so often on no news or fundamental changes to the company. First, I wanted to point something out. For those who don't think that trouble is afoot on GME (essentially those who think it was just a fad), no stock goes from 350 to 172 (march 10) in the matter of two hours on absolutely no news. I could give a billion other examples but that's the most glaring. Therefore, I think that we truly need to educate ourselves on FTDs and how they affect the price of GME. This will allow us to get to the bottom of what shorts are really up to and how they work.

    <p>
     Everyone talks about FTDs and the FTD cycle but it also seems that no one fully understands it or how it affects us. It seems like people just say "oh look tons of FTDs = tendies." Because of this, I believe that we need to do some DEEP digging to understand this dark side of finance.
    </p>

    <p>
     Why am I saying this? As I said above, the past few days have made me realize the important of FTDs because of comments/chats from other apes. I also just realized that on 2/24 when we came back from the dead (from 40ish to 90ish in an afternoon), the media said that was because of the announcement of the ousting of the CFO. Really???? A more than 100% jump in a few hours because of a CFO? What's more suspicious is that the relative calm period between that jump and the squeeze seems to like it could fit into one of the aforementioned FTD cycle periods (i.e. huge shorts during the January squeeze, cover on 2/24). To put more gas on the fire, when Cohen was announced as god of the board a few days ago, the stock went down!! What?! Tell me how that makes any sense whatsoever especially considering how much more hype and attention GME has gotten since then. I have been a huge proponent of saying that catalysts are the key to GME, and I still believe they are, but because the price of GME goes up and down massively at random times on no news, I think that there is more afoot and that FTDs are the key to understanding how the shorts are really operating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Therefore, I will be doing massive research on this topic (I will explain my methods below). HOWEVER, I urge all apes who are able to do this to do their own research on FTDs and shorts so that we can get a better idea of how they work and when shorts have to repay after these massive attacks. I'd urge you to start by reading this DD about FTD cycles, as it is gold:

     Finally, though I love chatting with all of you, please only message me about FTD stuff if you have some serious, detailed research and don't think that your account is big enough for others to see it. If you have some DD and an account that can get some traction, I encourage you to post that DD so that others can see it more quickly because I will be inactive for a little (explained below).

     So what about you, Hank?

     So, apes, to fully understand the breadth of FTDs and how they affect our baby, I will be taking a sabbatical for a few days or weeks. I will be hiding in the depths of my shed eating nothing but pringles, fig newtons, flaming hot Cheetos, and gushers. I will ONLY listen to Fifth Harmony, Megan Thee Stallion, and Linkin Park. I will only use the bathroom ONCE per day. I will only drink coconut water and WD-40. Most importantly, I will be decreasing the time I talk on the phone with my wife's boyfriend from 8 hours a day to JUST 45 FUCKING MINUTES. Now that's sacrifice. Apes, When I emerge from my shed, I hope to come to you as an enlightened primate. I hope to come to you as a primate who has earned the wrinkles on his brain. I hope to come to you as
