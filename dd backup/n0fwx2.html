     AMD posted their earnings results yesterday after close.
    </p>
    <p>
     EPS 52 vs EPS 44 (estimated). Meaning that they did almost 20% above expectations! Yet, the stock price dropped hard and is still dropping.

     Who has 798300 calls and 560100 puts on MVIS? Citadel.
    </p>
    <p>
     What did MVIS do in the past couple of days? Pumped from 10$ to 31$ and then dumped to 21$ this morning.

     Let's see what else these guys have...
    </p>
    <p>
     Tesla:
    </p>
    <p>
     20M calls
    </p>
    <p>
     18M puts
    </p>
    <p>
     what did Tesla do this week?
    </p>
    <img src="img/hlspp5op5xv61.png"/>
    <p>
     Tesla over the last 30 days went from 600 to 745 and in the last 5 days it started dropping.
    </p>
    <p>
     And all of that despite the news that their had a fantastic quarter and also that they managed to profit with over 100M+ in their BTC sale.
    </p>
