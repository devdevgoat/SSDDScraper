     <strong>
      TL;DR - Hedge funds are manipulating penny stocks by exploiting the OTC market and using a pump and dump strategy to raise funds in their war against us.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     -------------------------------------------------------------
    </p>
    <p>
     So I have strong evidence to suggest that hedgies are pumping &amp; dumping penny stocks to keep a constant inflow of cash to fight their war against us.
    </p>
    <p>
     I came about this from skimming through the FINRA OTC data.
    </p>
    <p>
     At first, I started to look at December data, because I wanted to see if hedge funds were trading penny stocks on inside information, by trading OTC the volume and price isn't affected on the charts and they can essentially trade behind the scenes. I wanted to know if they were making moves before the market caught up. But what I found instead was much much worse. So lets take a look...
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     and I went through the list, 1 by 1 and had a look at the charts.

    <p>
     And I notice something strange, not only were all the patterns very much alike, but they were all reacting to the GME price. Okay, so there's a common pattern here, which peaked my curiosity. So I looked at the data from another angle, we've seen the stocks that have closed really low, let's look at the ones with the most volume.

    <p>
     Right, well we can see that HCMC was the most traded, and we've already looked at that chart so let's move onto the others.

     Again, all this data reconfirmed what I was thinking, whoever was doing this was doing it on a large scale and for a specific reason. I already knew who it was, I just needed to confirm it. So let's go over the OTC data again. But this time, let's see who's actually trading those securities.

    <p>
     Let's start with HCMC

     Ah, well there's no fucking surprise there then is there? Let's look at the others to bolster our dataset

    <p>
     Ah, well this is concerning â€“ because that's nearly 3 million shares we can't see. You might not think that's a lot with a penny stock, but this stock was pumped from 50c to $14! Which is a x28 return on 3 million shares. That's a big fucking return! Similarly, if we go back another month on this very stock...

    <p>
     Right now this is extremely concerning, because somebody or some people traded 600 million shares and we have no fucking idea who. We can calculate from this how much money is being made, but that's for another DD â€“ this one is just to bring light to the issue. So let's continue...

     Oh look who it is again, it's
     <strong>

     </strong>
     ! Yaaaaay! Keep in mind this is for one month. There were another billion the month prior too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let's keep going... but I'm sure you are starting to get the picture by now.

     Shall we do one more?
    </p>
    <p>
     Let's look at WDLF through january and february.

    <p>
     Yea, we're numb to this now. But you're getting the picture. Citadel &amp; Co are trading an absolute fuck ton of penny stock shares. Shall we look at what they're doing with them? I'll use a single chart for this, but they all look the same anyway so the principle still stands.

     Closing comments: I'm not entirely sure if they can do this ad infinitum, but they can sure keep it up until it's patched. Secondly, I'm going to do another DD at some point to list all the hedgies taking part in the strategy, so we can see who we're up against, and then I'll do a bit of math to see how much money they're actually raising.
    </p>
    <p>
     From there, we can see how much we are costing the hedge funds, how much they're making and who we're fighting against.

     With this data, we can see that somebody is clearly hiding their trades. There's a lot to unpack from this, but that's for another DD.
