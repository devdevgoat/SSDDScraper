      TL;DR: Margin is calling. Below is a list of a bunch of other stocks that SPECIFICALLY CITADEL is shorting into oblivion to make money to pay for their debt. Oh, by the way, it's not working out for them.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Not financial advice. I just like the stock. All of them.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     I'll keep this short and sweet, it's just a bunch of Ortex/FINRA data on
     <strong>
      stocks that
     </strong>
     <strong>
      Citadel is MASS PRINTING
     </strong>
     to make their money back. You will see some crazy shit here.
    </p>
    <p>
     The goal of this DD is to
     <strong>
      show the correlation between some MASSIVELY shorted stocks that have yet to cover as of 4/22
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      Citadel's involvement within the OTC/Dark Pools.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    </p>
    <p>
     Let's start with the tendie man, $GME as our reference. Remember that
     <strong>
      the short data for $GME is MASSIVELY INACCURATE because they have only pretended to cover by buying ITM calls.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
     We know already what's going on with $GME, don't need to get into it. Same for $AMC. I would post photos of the Ortex and FINRA data but Reddit has a 20 image post limit. Dumb, but I'm sure you get the point.
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay, here's where things get
     <strong>
      CRAZY.
     </strong>
     Have you heard of
     <strong>
      Ocugen? ($OCGN)
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Neither had I. Until I noticed that
     <strong>
      THE ENTIRE THING IS SHORTED TO 100% UTILIZATION AND MORE THAN THE FLOAT (189M) TRADED TODAY, 4/22.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     ​
    </p>
    <p>
     <img src="img/v36lkbuk5vu61.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p>
     Here's the weird thing:
     <strong>
      THE PRICE IS GOING
     </strong>
     <strong>
      <em>
       UP.
      </em>
     </strong>
     Shorted stocks
     <strong>
      DON'T GO UP. Unless... YOU'RE PRINTING SHARES JUST TO PRINT THEM TO MAKE MONEY WITH NO REPERCUSSIONS.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Don't believe me? Well...
    </p>
    <p>
     ​
    </p>
    <p>
     <img src="img/us7ezvto5vu61.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p>
     Did I mention that
     <strong>
      THE PUBLIC FLOAT OF $OCGN IS ONLY 189M? SEEMS SUS...
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     It goes deeper. Ever heard of $VXRT? You know,
     <strong>
      THE ONE WITH THE NEGATIVE BETA?
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     ​
    </p>
    <p>
     <img src="img/ure7yeir5vu61.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Hmm I wonder if it's been shorted...
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     ​
    </p>
    <p>
     <img src="img/janmdn1u5vu61.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      HMM, THAT'S STRANGE... BY CITADEL? YOU PRINTING SHARES OVER THERE?
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     ​
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
     Well, isn't that interesting. Keep in mind too that the stock is
     <strong>
      GOING UP
     </strong>
     as well, meaning since they can't pull out,
     <strong>
      THEY MUST GO DEEPER.
     </strong>
     Just kidding, although remember that they
     <strong>
      MAKE MONEY
     </strong>
     printing shares, and demand has shot up for $VXRT.
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay so what else? How about:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      $FSR:
      <strong>
       134M Float
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      $NKLA:
      <strong>
       169M Float
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      $SKLZ:
      <strong>
       227M Float
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      $MVIS:
      <strong>
       155M Float
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      $RIOT:
      <strong>
       82M Float
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      $ALDX:
      <strong>
       38M Float
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      $BNGO:
      <strong>
       276M Float
      </strong>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     Yup. And those are just the ones I found in a couple of hours. The list is
     <strong>
      most likely enormous.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     You want the data?
     <strong>
      Here's the data with comments on each image:

     Here's

    </p>
    <p>
     Here's
     <strong>
      $NKLA:
     </strong>
     Look at that
     <strong>
      HUGE spike in volume, and there AIN'T NO SHORTS BEING COVERED.
     </strong>

    <p>
     Here's $SKLZ.
     <strong>
      Look at the price action at the end. It's GOING UP despite the short interest. Someone AIN'T COVERING.

     Here's
     <strong>
      $RIOT.
     </strong>
     Did you know that
     <strong>
      THEY SHORTED IT BY TWICE ITS FLOAT OTC? (82M)?
     </strong>

    <p>
     ​
    </p>
    <p>
     Here's
     <strong>
      $BNGO. Again, look at the price action. It's going UP. And if shorts AREN'T RESPONSIBLE for it, then MARGIN CALLS will be coming for similar situations.
     </strong>

     <strong>
      So what have we learned?
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Buy more $GME. Buy more $AMC.
     </strong>
     You can risk the other ones in this list,
     <strong>
      but personally I like the stonk.
     </strong>
     The way we win this thing
     <strong>
      is if we HODL ON WHILE THE PRICE CLIMBS,
     </strong>
     and while these stonks certainly can and most likely will go up,
     <strong>
      they are more of a demonstration that Citadel and friends are most certainly fuk.
     </strong>
     These stonks are shorted into oblivion to stave Citadel its execution,
     <strong>
      which is coming for them very soon.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Edit 1: Added some clarification, added "not financial advice," clarified that we actually just really like the stonk.
