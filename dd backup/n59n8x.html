     DTCC is imposing a 100% haircut for MBS bonds "Not Rated or Rated below Aa2/AA"

     What does this mean?

     " The recent financial crisis centered on the sale and repurchase (“repo”) market, a very large short-term collateralized debt market. Repo transactions often involve overcollateralization. The extent of overcollateralization is known as a “haircut.” Why do haircuts exist? And what determine the size of the haircut? We show that the existence of haircuts is due to sequential trade in which parties may default and intermediate lenders face liquidity needs. When there is a positive probability that the borrower will default, then the lender’s liquidity needs and own default risk in a subsequent transaction to sell the collateral become paramount. The haircut size depends on (i) the default probabilities of the borrower, (ii) the liquidity needs of the lender, (iii) the default probability of the lender in a subsequent repo transaction and (iv) the nature of the collateral "

     So, what are the implications behind a 100% haircut. Well, this essentially makes all MBS /CMBS bonds that are "Not Rated or Rated below Aa2/AA" worthless as collateral. Why is this important? Because in the Repo Market (

     ) collateral is king.
    </p>
    <p>
     The repo market is the glue that holds our global economy together, and it's fueled by bonds. In laymans, Repo Markets are where big banks go for 24hr loans. These 24hr loans mean they don't need cash on hand, and can utilize it in the market. These markets are integral to ensuring our global economy runs smoothly. If the repo markets go under, we get 2008 all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Edit: 
Let me add this example from the knvesropedia article, familiar?
    </p>
    <p>
     “Long-Term Capital Management's (LTCM) Failure and Collateral Haircuts Example
LTCM was a hedge fund started in 1993. By 1998 it had amassed massive losses, nearly resulting in a collapse of the financial system. The basis of LTCM's profit model, which worked very well for a while, was to suck up small profits from market inefficiencies. This is commonly called arbitrage. The firm used historical models to highlight opportunities and then deployed capital to profit from them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Each opportunity typically only produced a small amount of profit, so the firm utilized leverage—or borrowed money—in order to increase the gains. The firm had $5 billion in assets, yet controlled over $1 trillion worth of positions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Banks and other institutions allowed LTCM to borrow or leverage so much, with little collateral, mainly because they viewed the firm and their positions as non-risky. Ultimately, though, the firm's model failed to predict inefficiencies accurately, and those massively sized positions began to lose far more money than the firm actually had...and more money than many of the banks and institutions that lent to them or allow them to purchase assets had.
    </p>
    <p>
     The failure of LTCM, which required a bailout of the financial system, resulted in much higher haircut rules in terms of what can be posted as collateral, and how much the haircut has to be. LTCM had basically no haircuts, yet today an average investor buying regular stocks is subject to a 50% haircut when using those stocks as collateral against the amount borrowed on a margin trading account.
So, let's start tying some of this together.”
    </p>
    <p>
     What we know:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      DTCC is making all bonds below a Aa2/AA rating worthless in MBS repo markets, they're also devaluing AAA/Aa2/AA by 7%.
     </li>
     <li>
      The DTCC will only do this if they fear foreclosure, or high risk in an asset. In this case Mortgage Backed Securities and Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities.
     </li>
    </ol>

     This looks to have happened before, that being said the relation to BOFA was not there at the time. Per my understanding, BOFA shutting these two wings down means they're getting out of the MBS/CMBS game.

     Someone agrees.

     Final Edit 5/5:
    </p>
    <p>
     Just got off the phone with the DTC's risk department to see if they could provide any additional insight. Here's some takeaways.
    </p>
    <p>
     Calvin was kind enough to let me know a couple of things. One, this hasn't been done before February. This is a new line of credit that was just established post rona.  This was because of something called Reg W (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulation-w.asp#:~:text=Regulation%20W%20is%20a%20U.S.,requires%20collateral%20for%20certain%20transactions.)
    </p>
    <p>
     The list of lenders is updated manually and applications start in early May, hence the update. Two lenders fell off the list this go around so they sent an updated list and re-published it.
    </p>
    <p>
     From the sound of it, there were some issues with Reg W compliance and some of the lenders had to drop off.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     So what do we know now, and has my theory altered?
    </p>
    <p>
     I believe my timeline has altered, unbeknownst to me this program is for the following:
    </p>
    <p>
     "How Regulation W Works
Regulation W was published in 2003, to consolidate rulemaking under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. Its main purposes were to protect banks from financial risk resulting from transactions with their affiliates and to limit the banks' ability to use the U.S. deposit insurance system to cover their losses from such transactions."
    </p>
    <p>
     and
    </p>
    <p>
     https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section23a.htm (Very long read)
    </p>
    <p>
     Alrighty, final theory.

     After researching, from what I can tell, our hero was back at it again blowing the whistle this time to the public via code. In the post above, it shows his final twitter header before deleting his twitter. The one previous to that, was simply a picture of bricks and mortar. My assumption is he was alluding to the CMBS fraud that got whistle blown about last year.
    </p>
    <p>
     Event #2:
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay so, last year a whistleblower goes the the SEC and says "Hey! They fraudin again!"
https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-62
    </p>
    <p>
     Event #3:
    </p>
    <p>
     SEC starts looking into it, sees the fraud, and calls the DTCCs. Once they investigate and collaborate they start rolling out changes late December. Hence the bond ratings changing overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
     More whistleblowers come out as they realize the music is ending and they'll make more than they would've bonused.
    </p>
    <p>
     Event#4:
    </p>
    <p>
     TBD
    </p>
    <p>
     That's all I got for now folks, seems to be huge news even though it did occur already. I think we may be seeing the effects of this play out over the rest of this year so keep your nose to the ground.
