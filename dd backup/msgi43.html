     This is not financial advice, obviously.
    </p>
    <p>
     So I would like to start by saying that all of this is public information. I started from the company's Linkedin address posted in the message being sent to the redditors:

    <p>
     The founder of the company is named Ty Hoffer (Tyson Clay Hoffer):

     It seems that this is not Ty's first rodeo, he was the President of a company called Winning Media LLC (there is no Linkedin page for this company, but I found the actual website):

     Article from Barron's from 2019 in which it's illustrated how Winning Media LLC was paid between 60K-100K to pump up the stock price through articles which contained statements which “encouraged investors to purchase the stock of the Company" . Some shady shit going on here.

     Now... I suck at investigative journalism, but if somebody who is actually good at this wants to look through this information and see what else they can find, please go ahead. It's getting late here and I must get some shut-eye.

     EDIT: Okay, this blew up, I did not expect it to get so many updoots. Thank you for taking the time to read. I feel absolutely disgusted of what I've found and what I've read in this post:

     I knew that paid shills and FUD spreaders were a thing, but I did not expect this to be an actual fucking business, operating without any shame, out in the open. And please keep in mind, this is JUST ONE COMPANY facilitating the manipulation of stock prices through untruthful articles and paid influencers. JUST ONE. This is a profitable business model that doesn't require any special skills or knowledge, so I imagine there are thousands if not tens of thousands of such companies operating around the globe (I have no proof though...).
    </p>
    <p>
     For a company like Citadel, which has almost unlimited amounts of money, it would be as easy as flipping a switch to engage with all these companies and hire an army of shills and FUD spreaders to spread misinformation and ultimately cause panic amongst GME holders.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm not saying Kenneth the 3'rd and Citadel are doing this. I'm saying that if they wanted to, it would be extremely easy, convenient and effective.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, unfortunately for them, we are retards with a lot of free time and a vendetta against injustice and lies. And so, I will do my DD. I will spread the knowledge to my fellow apes. I will not trust any one person, one news outlet, one youtube channel. I will switch sub after sub in case they are compromised, and in the end I will win.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because hedgies... no matter what you do, how many marketing companies you pay, how many influencers you get on your side, I WILL NEVER SELL MY GME FOR ANYTHING LESS THAN 20 FUCKING MILLION GOD DAMN DOLLARS. And although I am just a drop of water in the ocean, the ocean is made of water drops just like me.

     I'll end with an article from the SEC, admitting this is a problem and calling them fraudsters. However at the end of this article you will find the picture below:

     EDIT 2: From u/catima (thanks for researching this!!!):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Tyson Hoffer = Co-founder of Life Water Media since 2020
      <br/>
      Tyson Hoffer = president of Winning Media LLC since 2002
     </p>
     <p>
      Winning Media LLC feature in this 2015 paper from Journal of Forensic &amp; Investigative Accounting:
      <a href="https://digitalcommons.wcupa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&amp;context=acc_facpub">

     </p>
     <p>
      In a public disclosure of the source of revenues for a stock promoter, TribecaInvestments, Inc. reported a total of $1,442,500 in campaign revenues from Winning Media over 10 months in 2013 for 46 different tickers (p. 332).
     </p>
     <p>
      The paper finds that "Nevada corporations dominate pump and dump promotional campaigns... While this practice is technically illegal, it is the state corporate law that influences or governs the liability against these managers. The Nevada Effect contends Nevada state law is, by design, lax in this area and facilitates these behaviors (CFM 2014)."
     </p>
     <p>
      That's basically all I've found so far, nothing unexpected but Ty &amp; friends have been doing this for years.
