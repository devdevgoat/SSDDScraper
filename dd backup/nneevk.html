     Hello fellow Apes,
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Obligatory Disclaimer: I am not a Financial Advisor, and this is not Financial Advice. Always do your own homework. That being said.. lets get started.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      TL,DR:
     </strong>
     Hedies R FuQ. I used data from FTSE Russell's own Database 'Mergent Online' to calculate the current ownership numbers for GME... and my TITS ARE JACKED.
    </p>
    <p>
     I found some very interesting ownership numbers for GME today. I am using Mergent Online as my data source, which is produced by FTSE Russell.. yes the same FTSE Russell that runs the Russell 2000 Index, which GME is
     <em>
      currently
     </em>
     a part of.  I have access to Mergent through the university I am currently at while finishing my bachelors in Finance in a few months.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now before we get fully started on a simple ownership analysis.. I'm going to take us on a trip back to middle school math class and the dreaded topic of Algebra. Proportions and Cross Multiplying are a pretty simple topic and go something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
     ​
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
     For making Ownership calculations we need a base to go off of. Mergent Online (once again information reported by the index that GME is a part of)  reports the ownership of GME at the following:
    </p>
    <p>
     <img src="img/6io407b6yy171.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p>
     Mergent Online has
     <strong>
      GME Shares Outstanding as 69,936,000
     </strong>
     . We need to keep in mind that this is a number reported
     <strong>
      as of 1/30/2021
     </strong>
     . Since then, GME has made a secondary offering of 3,500,000 shares. This gives us an
     <strong>
      Issuer-Stated Total Shares Outstanding of 73,436,000 or 73.436 Million shares.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Now that we know how many shares there are
     <strong>
      <em>
       supposed
      </em>
     </strong>
     to be, lets check out the Insider Ownership.
    </p>
    <p>
     ​
    </p>
    <p>
     <img src="img/9haw4oug0z171.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p>
     We can see that the Insider Ownership is broken into two distinct categories:
     <strong>
      Direct and Indirect Ownership
     </strong>
     . Direct Ownership is when the shares are listed
     <em>
      directly
     </em>
     in your name, and not say.. in shelter company like
     <strong>
      RC Ventures
     </strong>
     . We will do two different calculations in order to display the situation correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mergent lists the Direct Ownership at 8,057,864 shares totaling 11.52% ownership pie (we all like pies). This leaves 88.48% left over..
     <strong>
      <em>
       but  how many shares is that wrinkly brained ape?
      </em>
     </strong>
     Lets put our trusty friend
     <strong>
      Algebra
     </strong>
     to the test.
    </p>
    <p>
     (11.52/8,057,864) = (88.46/X)
    </p>
    <p>
     11.52X=712,798,649.44   .. now to find X we divide each side by 11.52.
    </p>
    <p>
     X=61,874,882.76
    </p>
    <p>
     Now to check our math we add the 88.46% to the 11.52% to get a total ownership number.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Previously stated ownership: 69,936,000
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     8,057,864 + 61,874,882.76=
     <strong>
      69,932,746.76
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     To me.. being around 4,000 shares within the "Stated Shares Outstanding" checks out enough to me. To calculate the Free Float I added in the extra 3.5 million shares that were a part of the secondary offering
     <strong>
      (total shares outstanding 73,436,000)
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     This would put GME at a
     <strong>
      Free Float of 65,378,136 shares.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      BUT APE NO INCLUDE TENDIE MASTER!!
     </strong>
     I know, we are getting there.
    </p>
    <p>
     *
     <strong>
      RC Ventures WAS NOT listed on the "Direct Ownership" list. The Indirect Ownership is stated at 15,760,670 shares.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Adding the two 'Insider Ownerships' together gives us the following:
    </p>
    <p>
     8,057,864 + 15,760,670 =
     <strong>
      23,818,534 for insider ownership
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     This new number would give us a
     <strong>
      Free Float of 49,617,466 or 49 Million shares.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Up until this point this is all stuff that we have basically already known.. its about to get a little more spicy.
     </em>
     Next we will cover the
     <strong>
      Institutional Ownership
     </strong>
     side. Now the Institutional numbers have always been wacky for GME, but I believe these next calculations provide insight into
     <strong>
      just how big of a hole hedgies have dug themselves.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      GME Institutional Ownership- As Stated by Mergent FTSE Russell:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     ​
    </p>
    <p>
     <img src="img/z3kg7s9q5z171.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Two things IMMEDIATELY stand out to me: #1 Institutions own 56,158,356 shares.... AT 28.87% ownership.. WHAT?!?
     </strong>
     This statistic is what is
     <strong>
      <em>
       REPORTED
      </em>
     </strong>
     to the index, these numbers definitely could be fudged.. but most likely to the downside and not the upside.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      <em>
       So smart Ape.. if Institutions own 28.87% of GME with 56M shares.. how many shares does everyone else (aka Insiders and Retail) own at 71.13%?
      </em>
     </strong>
     Once again, our friend Algebra comes into play.
    </p>
    <p>
     (28.87/56,158,356) = (71.13/X)
    </p>
    <p>
     28.87X = 3,994,543,862.28   (now we divide each side by 28.87)
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      X= 138,363,140.36    or 138.36M shares.. GO APES!
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     If we then subtract out the higher Insider Ownership number (Direct + Indirect) this gives us a
     <strong>
      <em>
       Retail Control
      </em>
     </strong>
     <strong>
      of 114,544,606.36 shares or 114 MILLION SHARES.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      <em>
       What the Fuq did hedgies get themselves into?!?
      </em>
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Now according to the "Institutional Ownership" numbers I wanted to see around about how many
     <strong>
      Naked Shorts
     </strong>
     the firms had rehypothecated. To get the Total Shares Outstanding we would then add Institutional Ownership with Retail and Insider Ownership stats:
    </p>
    <p>
     56,158,356 + 138,363,140 =
     <strong>
      194,521,496 shares.. 194 million fuqing shares.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     So with the institutional numbers and the Issuer stated numbers I came to the conclusion that:
    </p>
    <p>
     194,521,496 - 73,436,000 =
     <strong>
      121,085,496 or 121 MILLION SHARES NAKED
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      What did Kenny get himself into.. well covering 121 MILLION shares he can't get his hands on because 114 MILLION are in the hands of Apes.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      <em>
       Please keep in mind these are the reported numbers.. they could truly be MUCH higher.
      </em>
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     I am always open to criticisms and questions/discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Be Excellent and Rock on Fellow Apes.

     EDIT 4 (5/29 afternoon): I am doing a more comprehensive review of ownership comparing the numbers reported by Mergent and FTSE Russell to those of: GameStop Proxy, Yahoo Finance Premium, FinteliO, Whale Wisdom, Koyfin, Fidelity Research, Nasdaq, CNNMoney, and MarketBeat (I think I named them all.. may be more I'll update as needed). I am trying to match numbers to see if I can find any discrepancies in data reported.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have also contacted Mergent &amp; FTSE Russell to try and see if I can get any information on
     <em>
      how
     </em>
     they source their information. On their website it states they have a
     <strong>
      dedicated data team that updates the data live daily from multiple market sources
     </strong>
     . I am not sure how true this is, but in the data columns it did say "as of 5/28/21". I will updated on any information about data sources that I receive.
