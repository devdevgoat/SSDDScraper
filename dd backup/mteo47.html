<p>EDIT 4:</p>
<p>JANUARY 11th $SPXS REVERSE STOCK SPLIT</p>
<p><img src="img/cwr3opgwdyt61.png"/></p>
<p>Legit question for the more well versed folk out there. What happens if you are short shares that never existed, then they get combined into 1 share?</p>
<p>The fuck?</p>
<p>Historical values of some of these ETF's prior to 3 separate reverse Stock splits:</p>
<p><img src="img/99negsd2eyt61.png"/></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>EDIT 5:</p>
<p>My Brain... ITS OVERFLOWING:</p>
<p>What if theory:</p>
<p>Inverse ETF's are designed to go DOWN. A Reverse Stock split is a KNOWN quantity to occur.</p>
<p>Hypothetical: If you Naked Short an Inverse ETF (synthetic shares), then you have a Reverse Stock Split happen (10 get combined into 1) in theory you got paid crazy money on a stock that no longer exists due to the nature of these reverse splits.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>LOOK WHAT THIS IS MADE OUT OF:</p>

<p>EDIT 10:</p>
<p>Theory for Reverse Stock Splits on Inverse ETFs, and why the share price from 12 years ago is still alive today:</p>
<p>Consider this:</p>
<p>A reverse stock split on a regular ETF would be exactly that, a 1:2 - "Increasing" share value.</p>
<p>A regular stock split on a regular ETF would be exactly that, a 2:1 - "Decreasing" share value.</p>
<p>A reverse stock split on an Inverse ETF = 1:2 "Decreasing" share value.</p>
<p>A regular stock split on an Inverse ETF = 2:1 "Increasing" share value.</p>
<p>Remember, this is opposite day with these inverse ETF's. The act of reverse splitting is the same as a regular ETF's stock split, IE - more shares = same money.</p>
<p>Now its simply, Less shares = same money.</p>
<p>Due to how we all know that the ticker is NOT representative of the real price in a manipulated security it is incredibly easy to see how SPXS may be like a bundle of taut cords, about to snap but not readily apparent until it simply happens.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>EDIT 11:</p>
<p>TA;DR -</p>
<p>SPXS goes down, SPY goes up.</p>
<p>SPXS goes up, SPY goes down.</p>
<p>GME correlates with SPXS movements.</p>
<p>If GME goes up, SPXS will go up, and SPY will go down.</p>
<p>Citadel &amp; friends are HYPER Long on SPXS (and other Inverse ETF's) = Profit from GME Mooning. HODL will make all their profits get eaten tho by hungry apes.</p></content></body>
