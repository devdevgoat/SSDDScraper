     Ending around 156.08, down 6.28%. An expected pullback. Perhaps we will bounce tomorrow. See you all tomorrow!

     Volume picking up. Bit of an upside breakout/mean reversion.

     Well helloooo there Mr. Wedge. Volume too low as of now for a major breakout. If volume kicks back in, perhaps we can see an upside breakout.

     This particular line, resistance of the wedge is now acting as a support line. We could continue inching lower through the day.

     Option volume still pretty low. I feel as if most of the action has not yet started. Volume also sitting incredibly low.

     Majority of those Calls are sold. Either sold to close or short Calls.

     We're moving below that channel right now, but we can end up spending a lot of time bouncing in that channel.

     Let's wait for 10AM when the action will probably start.

     Premarket Analysis

    <p>
     Bit of a small skirmish premarket. GME gapped and was immediately shorted down.
