<p>Since I can barely read/write myself, I'll keep this short and get straight to the point. There are way too many DD's out there, written by apes way wiser than me, with DETAILED explanations of everything I'm talking about. SUCH AS THIS SUPER IN-DEPTH DD REGARDING OBV IF ANY SMOOTH BRAINS WANNA DEVELOP A FEW WRINKLES BY u/Cuttingwater_ : <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdyfpc/gmes_price_continues_to_be_artificially_deflated/">https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdyfpc/gmes_price_continues_to_be_artificially_deflated/</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210405032914/https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdyfpc/gmes_price_continues_to_be_artificially_deflated/"> (wb)</a></p>
<p>For anyone else who's been here for while, we all know what the fuck OBV is at this point right?</p>
<p>HERE'S A QUICK SYNOPSIS:</p>
<p>All you need to know is that "On Balance Volume (OBV)" is a technical indicator that uses volume changes to make price predictions. This indicated is based on REAL data that has already happened, and therefore cannot be manipulated. It's literal purpose is to show how the price is moving. OBV TL;DR: <strong>If the price closes higher than the previous price, OBV goes UP. If the price closes below the previous price, OBV goes DOWN.</strong></p>
<p>Now I'm a fucking illiterate, so naturally I am a visual learner. I've pulled the charts of a bunch of random ass stocks, including: AMC, APHA, APPL, CHWY, MVIS, PLTR, SNDL, TSLA, and WFC to compare and show how their OBV's trend according to the price moves.</p>

<p>Ok now look at GME... LMAO</p>
<p>​</p>

<p>The OBV for GME is absolutely artistic looking. As we all know, the price of GME is heavily manipulated. The OBV during January, specifically when the price was $482, the OBV was around <strong>356.22 million</strong>. The current OBV of GME is roughly <strong>730.11 million</strong>. And just doing a quick rough estimate with these numbers, based on percentage proportions, I believe that GME's current real price is actually somewhere between $800-1k.</p>
<p>TL;DR: OBV is generally used to confirm price moves, and is more than 2x the OBV in January's peak, which leads me to believe the suppressed REAL price of GME is currently somewhere between $800-1k.</p>
<p>I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYTHING AND COULD BE MISUNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPT OF OBV ENTIRELY. IF THAT'S THE CASE, PLEASE JUST FLAME THE FUCK OUT OF ME IMMEDIATELY. OTHERWISE...</p>
<p>MY TITS ARE ABSOLUTELY JACKETH RIGHT NOW!</p>
<p>THAT'S ALL FOLKS, BUY AND HODL FOR THE INFINITY SQUEEZE</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong>: FORGOT TO ADD AMC BUT LOOKS LIKE AMC HAS THE SAME ANOMALY AS GME HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM</p>

<p>I WANTED TO KEEP THIS POST AS BASIC AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND AS POSSIBLE, BUT AS FELLOW APE u/Criand HAS SAID:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OBV = OBV + Volume; if price goes up  </p>
<p>OBV = OBV; if price stays the same  </p>
<p>OBV = OBV - Volume; if price goes down  </p>
<p>OBV on normal stocks will look roughly like the price chart. But GME is unique. We tend to have price go down significantly with little volume, but always price goes up with large volume days. You shouldn't see that. Large volume days should have some days where price drops, but that has yet to happen for gme.  </p>
<p>So now we see OBV continuing to rise, which screams manipulation. The true price should be following the obv more or less, resulting in OPs $900+</p>
</blockquote>
<p>​</p>
<p>My take from this is: despite there being a dip in AH, the OBV that is shown to still CURRENTLY higher be at a higher level than it was in January. Like I've said, I'm not sure what this all means, but I guess we can at least add this as another anomaly related to GME that doesn't occur it any other stock.</p>
<p>Additionally, PLEASE STOP GIVING ME AWARDS! USE YOUR MONEY TO BUY THE STOCK THAT YOU LIKE!</p></content></body>
