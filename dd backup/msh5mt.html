<p>Someone mentioned in a comment that they got all of the recent SEC filings mixed up so I slapped this together really quick. Hopefully it helps.</p>
<p>Big ups to u/c-digs who wrote nearly everything linked. If one of my summaries is hella wrong please let me know and I will fix it! </p>
<p>Here’s a quick and dirty rundown:</p>

(submitted for approval 3/10, approved 4/16 and now in effect)</p>
