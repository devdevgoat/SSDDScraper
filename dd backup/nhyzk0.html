<content><p>So, we all knew today was going to be a battle for the $180 point because of the options expiry on this date. Lo and behold, right before we got to the $180 marker at 1:30, we got pushed down pretty intensely. </p>
<p>Now, we had seen a few weeks back a bunch of negative trades at settlement in after hours at 4:15, and then suddenly that stopped. But when the trade volume was exceptionally low, we kept seeing trades disappearing from minute to minute. So if there's a large red candle, and you refresh your stonk tracker du jour, that total is always reduced, as though the trades are counting towards the price movement LIVE, and then they disappear, never to be settled. </p>
<p>I don't know how often this happens with other stock, but I've been waiting for a good window of price crush to analyze this, and here are my findings:</p>
<p>|<strong>Time of Candle</strong>|<strong>Trades on ATP</strong>|<strong>Trades after Refresh</strong>|<strong>Difference</strong>|<strong>Percentage Reduced</strong>|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|1:30|14038|7505|6533|46.5379684|
|1:31|15968|10817|5151|32.2582665|
|1:32|15718|9173|6545|41.6401578|
|1:33|13881|9107|4774|34.3923348|
|1:34|13592|8883|4709|34.6453796|
|1:35|12204|8380|3824|31.3339889|
|1:36|9101|6341|2760|30.3263378|
|1:37|5228|2576|2652|50.7268554|
|1:38|7000|3850|3150|45.0|
|1:39|11962|7834|4128|34.5092794|
|<strong>Total for window</strong>|<strong>118692</strong>|<strong>74466</strong>|<strong>44226</strong>|<strong>37.2611465</strong>|</p>
<p>Now, I'm not that wrinkly. But a reduction of 37% of shares traded feels like an awful lot over a ten minute window, especially because the price got pushed down from $179.01 to $176.81 in that time. Someone please take this information and explain to me the following:</p>
<p>1) Is this abnormal for other stocks?</p>
<p>2) Does this sort of trade erasure happen throughout all points of the day, regardless of price movement? and</p>
<p>3) If it does, is the percentage outside the bounds of normalcy?</p>
<p>Also, I have comparative screenshots before and after I refreshed, if anyone wants them (can't figure out how to insert them into a text post (using old.reddit).</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> formatting.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> If someone knows a lot about the details of how a trade is recorded and settled, that might go a long way to understanding how someone might execute trades on a market, and then never settle them. And if we can figure that out, we can figure out how they might be continuing to control price movement without generating additional failures to deliver, that they eventually need to deal with. It's just kicking the can down the road (so buy and hodl is still the only move) but if we can make this manipulation visible enough, then the DTC/SEC etc. might make some more rules to cover their own asses.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> There's another one happening right now, just after 3pm. If anyone has their tracker open and wants to make a table to collect the trades per candle, then refresh and confirm, I'd be grateful.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 4:</strong> Ok, so here's a longer table for the drop at about 3pm, started a couple minutes before, and then continued a few minutes after the drop. Oddly, the first minute of my comparison (2:58) goes UP by 488 trades, not sure what's going on there. But the rest of this window (despite significantly lesser trade volume per minute) also lost over a third of its trades to thin air, 33.7%</p>

<p><strong>Edit 5:</strong> I will stop adding these edits now, but someone messaged me suggesting I clarify my system/app. I'm using Fidelity's Active Trader Pro, my system is very stone age... watch for dip that in my mind appears artificial, note the time and trades on the candle for each minute of sample, then refresh GME by going to another stock and coming back, then do the same for the same window. Subtract second column from first column to get third column, then divide third column by first column.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 6:</strong> Ok, I did one more, the last twenty minutes of the day, as that's when a large push of trades come in:</p>

<p><strong>Edit 7:</strong> Some formatting and grammatical corrections.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 8:</strong> I'm a moron and my tables were formatted at the wrong decimal place... corrected. Thanks u/bryanthecrab</p></content></body>
