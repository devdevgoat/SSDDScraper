<content><p>Hi ape detectives! Today me (Watson) and our resident Sherlock u/Jerrynka69 bring you a solution to the most recent DFV tweet ( <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1380611475757236226/photo/1">UNO Kitty DFV Tweet</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210409201141/https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1380611475757236226/photo/1"> (wb)</a> ), cryptically sending us a message like only he, The One Who Is Not a Cat can.</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, we'll pay attention to highlighted cards which have been edited in. There's 2 decks, one on the left side in hand and one on the right side, probably a discard pile.</li>
<li>Check the left hand UNO deck. You can see 2,1,wild,6,4. A reverse has been played so read it in reverse and sub the wild for 1 (Wild is highlighted, in the original photo Ace is highlighted and Ace = 1, thanks u/hnddt1) - <strong>4 / 16 / 21.</strong> A date we all know very well - his options are expiring and some other DDs have been pointing to it!</li>
<li>On the right side we see <strong>WILD</strong> highlighted, we can see reverse and some other numbers. ~~We've been unable to crack the other numbers but as they're not highlighted we assume they have been used just to cover the original card art.~~</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT: Thanks you u/Thilanii we got this juicy piece of info: "<em>Youâ€™ve got 2 2 and 4 on the right side with the wild card. What happened on 2/24? We opened at 44.70, ended at 91.71, and after hours we peaked 200 a few times. Coincidence? Nope.</em> "</p>
<p>Many other detective apes pointed out that the <strong>right hand numbers could be also read as 4/22</strong> - so thatâ€™s probably a possible date (I know we donâ€™t do dates here, Iâ€™m just reporting the finds) to look forward to!</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the lamp above kitties heads very very closely. You'll see <strong>5 GME logos</strong> there! Do you know how many trading days are left until 4 / 16 / 21? <strong>5.</strong>(<a href="https://imgur.com/a/7IxdbKw">Check this GIF</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210410014641/https://imgur.com/a/7IxdbKw"> (wb)</a> from u/vivvienne if you can't see the logos!) 5. How many kitties do we have playing? <strong>5.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>What does this tell us?</p>
<p>In our opinion (GME bulls Discord investigators) it <strong>means that 4 / 16 / 21 is gonna be WILD</strong>. His options are expiring and with the right side numbers he's point at the last time we saw a very nice price hike after a dip!</p>
<p>Also, there is a possibility DFV has planned for this date, check out this DD: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/trollwallstreet/comments/m0ndyr/gme_target_dates_jan_15_april_16_not_march_19/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb">https://www.reddit.com/r/trollwallstreet/comments/m0ndyr/gme_target_dates_jan_15_april_16_not_march_19/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210415072413/https://www.reddit.com/r/trollwallstreet/comments/m0ndyr/gme_target_dates_jan_15_april_16_not_march_19/"> (wb)</a></p>
<p>There is 5 GME logos on the lamp and 5 kitties playing, which means 5 trading days left until that date.</p>
<p>Notice fat cash stacks on table, very thematic too! Weâ€™re playing for big cash indeed - plus the kitty playing is <strong>ALL IN!</strong> (thanks u/Same-Tour9465)</p>
<p>Also, this just in: GME Youtube just uploaded a video with 5 nights at Freddy's. The title?</p>
<p><strong>DECODED</strong> | <strong>FIVE</strong> NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S SPRING COLORWAY PLUSHIES.</p>
<p>Tits? Jacked.</p>
<p>Tendies? In the fryer.</p>
<p>Hands? Fucking diamond.</p>
<p>All-seeing award from anonymous source? Incoming. (Don't be stingy on me u/deepfuckingvalue !)</p>
<p>If anybody has more clues, let us know!</p>
<p>â€”</p>
<p>New clue by u/Financial-Process-86 : WAIT. A. SECOND.</p>
<p>Five nights at freddies is a game where you are constantly scared by FAKE ANIMALS, (animatronic machines) until you get to the fifth night. At which point YOU WIN.</p>
<p>The stock market is described as a zoo (ostrich, bulls, bears, sheep, pigs).</p>
<p>You have to be able to shine the light on the fake animals in order for the animals to not consume you.</p>
<p>SEE ANY PARALLELS?</p>
<p>I'M NOT CRAZY RIGHT?</p>

<p>New clue by u/baimeigui102460:</p>
<p>POSSIBLE NEW CLUE:</p>
<p>Did you apes notice the photo DFV posted is squeezed a bit when compared to the original?</p>
<p>Here is an original/unaltered version of the image:</p>
<p><a href="http://gastrotekadanontzat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gastroteka-Danontzat-Hondarribia-La-trastienda.jpg">http://gastrotekadanontzat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gastroteka-Danontzat-Hondarribia-La-trastienda.jpg</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210410032104/http://gastrotekadanontzat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gastroteka-Danontzat-Hondarribia-La-trastienda.jpg"> (wb)</a></p>
<p>Open up both images in two browser tabs and flip through them back and forth to see the effect. You'll see a squozening happening. He could have chosen any version of the image as a base to edit. Can't help but notice this.</p>
<p>Thoughts? u/pepsodont</p>
<p>â€”</p>
<p>EDIT: Just to make one thing clear - we don't think he's pointing to a squeeze date, nobody knows when that'll be. He's sending a message that he thinks something positively important / interesting will happen on that date. Might be just his options expiring. Might be a price hike. Who knows? Let's wait and see.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: For those who didn't know - DFV has been tweeting decreasing numbers in his cryptic tweets, like a countdown. This could be number 5 in sequence.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: RIP my inbox</p>
<p>EDIT 4: I donâ€™t want to cause positive panic at the disco, but I have a feeling DFVâ€™s awarder karma jumped substantially recently - itâ€™s up to 1 131 384 ðŸ˜³</p>
<p>EDIT 5: New clues by other detective apes added! Keep â€˜em coming!</p>
<p>EDIT 6: Looks like there is possibility of DFV knowing about 21/4/16 for SURE: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/trollwallstreet/comments/m0ndyr/gme_target_dates_jan_15_april_16_not_march_19/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb">https://www.reddit.com/r/trollwallstreet/comments/m0ndyr/gme_target_dates_jan_15_april_16_not_march_19/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210415072413/https://www.reddit.com/r/trollwallstreet/comments/m0ndyr/gme_target_dates_jan_15_april_16_not_march_19/"> (wb)</a></p></content></body>
