     The final picture is starting to come together. The ties of the former CFTC (who now works for citadel) &amp; SEC chairmen to the industry appear to be pointing to fraudulent activity in efforts to prolong the necessity of
     <strong>
      SOFR
     </strong>
     being implemented.
     <strong>
      SOFR
     </strong>
     the last time it was attempted to transitioned into (in 2019) almost IMPLODED the market due to many realizing that banks and others could not handle a higher interest rate (based off the

     /u/sharkbaitlol here again for another post in the
     <strong>
      "Chaos Theory"
     </strong>
     series that delves deeper into the underworking of the financial realm. Just for a reintroduction of myself from other posts, my career has revolved around the data realm having worked on data collection, interpretation and machine learning for the last decade or so. I am also a lifelong gamer and have always been addicted to identifying patterns in real-life and games.

     Former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton just took a job at
     <strong>
      Apollo Global Management

     in a newly created role of lead independent director on its board last month. We start digging here and find out that
     <strong>
      Tiger Global Management
     </strong>
     holds a 14.8% stake in; making them the largest shareholder of Apollo other than a private holdings company from Apollo themselves (BRH) (

     NOW we encounter our first conflict on interest here as we delve into
     <strong>
      Jay Clayton's
     </strong>
     new employer,
     <strong>
      Apollo Global Management.
     </strong>
     As it turns out the former CEO of
     <strong>
      Apollo
     </strong>
     stepped down
     <strong>
      JUST LAST MONTH
     </strong>
     because of his ties with
     <strong>
      Jeffery Epstein
     </strong>
     . Here's the story from a couple weeks ago ago.

    <p>
     <img src="img/j7jfsva7akt61.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
     Wait so you're telling me that the former SEC chairman is working for a company that was connected with one of the most infamous criminals of all time?
     <strong>
      YUP.
     </strong>
     Well at least the old CEO isn't there anymore right?

    <p>
     Now lets take a step back about two weeks ago or so; recall
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heath_Tarbert">
      Mr. Heath Tarbert

     ? Who was the former chairmen of the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission). Last we heard he just got hired by our boy
     <strong>
      Ken Griffin
     </strong>
     as his
     <strong>
      Chief Legal Officer.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Turns out that Jay Clayton and Heath Tarbert
     </strong>
     (brought in during the Trump administration)
     <strong>
      know each other pretty well. In-fact Heath had this to say about his
     </strong>
     <strong>
      <em>
       friend
      </em>
     </strong>
     <strong>
      Jay Clayton.

    <blockquote>

      <em>
       “It has been an honor to serve alongside Jay Clayton. He is one of the smartest and most capable transactional attorneys in the country and an

       <em>
        even better colleague and friend
       </em>
      </strong>
      <em>
       . As leaders of the SEC and CFTC, we have
      </em>
      <strong>
       <em>
        worked together closely
       </em>
      </strong>
      <em>

     . So now we have two former chairman of the organizations meant to control
     <strong>
      Wall Street
     </strong>
     who are working for the very thing they were regulating. The same
     <strong>
      Wall Street
     </strong>
     they were "harmonizing rules" for --- oh and one of them is working at a Hedge Fund associated with a criminal. Great, totally not a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      MY OPINION:
     </strong>
     There's nothing from these two from continually working together even now; only a few months have passed since these two were last collaborating. This begins to lead us into an ordeal that starts to paint a picture of what may have happened in the last few years and how some hedge funds might have further screwed themselves with super cheap interest rates introduced during the pandemic on loans with these two formerly at the helm stoking the flames.

     Wonder how

     As a result of their bankruptcy, 50,000 people lost their jobs when it became evident that during courthouse hearing in Sydney, Australia - $4.6 billion was owed and no one was extending out a hand to loan anymore to
     <strong>
      Greensill
     </strong>
     (THIS IS A BIG PIECE OF THIS STORY, HOLD THIS THOUGHT FOR NOW BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO GET CRAZY LATER ON).
    </p>
    <p>
     As a result different parts of

     <strong>
      MY OPINION:
     </strong>
     From researching around it seems that for one reason or another, consolidation of banks appears to be a focus headed into the near future.
     <strong>
      BlackRock
     </strong>
     is looking to somehow join the narrative and become further ingrained in the banking world. This becomes especially interesting considering how
     <strong>
      BlackRock
     </strong>
     is positioning themselves as
     <strong>
      the 'fourth branch of government'
     </strong>
     . I believe I explain this relationship a bit better in anticipation of what the future is going to bring (Section 4).

     I would add to this that he also has a fairly deep background in crypt0-currencies which explain the recent movement of
     <strong>
      C0inBase
     </strong>
     and the currencies associated with it.
     <strong>
      Gary

     is very likely to implement new legislation that favors crypt0. He's also fairly knowledgeable about darkpools and their inner workings.

    <p>
     One of the major concerns that I have however is that
     <strong>
      Gary
     </strong>
     was involved with bringing the big banks to light back in 2008. To have him appear now and for such a short period of time (his contract is until June when it'll be renegotiated) raises a bit of a flag.

     ) --- With so much of the world's loan market tied up in this "LIBOR",  why is it a big deal now? Well we know that the CFTC is the one establishing settlements for any rigging of game that may be taking place within interest rates.

    <p>
     <strong>
      Oh right, and the former chairman of the CFTC now works at Citadel was in charge of policing this for the last 4 years. In addition, what are the chances he's intertwined with the congress members who've received donations from Citadel do you think?  Seems like this LIBOR thing might be a problem for certain parties?

     is not a light topic. Thank you /u/RegularJDOE1234 &amp; /u/HCRDR on further research into this.

      There is about $350 - 400 trillion (yes that is TRILLIONS with a T, about 4x the size of the global economy) tied up in it.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     A short explanation of what
     <strong>
      LIBOR
     </strong>
     is:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      " Libor is an average interest rate calculated through submissions of interest rates by major banks across the world. "
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     IN 🦍 SPEAK, GRAB YOUR 🖍's IT'S TIME GO TO🏫🎒. Interest is something all of us have dealt with in one fashion or another. Credit card payments, mortgages, student loans. The concept is all the same. You borrow money from the bank, and they tell you that you'll be paying a fee monthly (known as the interest rate) on top of the money you've loaned out from them. On top of this you get told what your interest will be ahead of time (forward looking interest rate) so you know what to expect your bill to be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now the reason
     <strong>
      LIBOR
     </strong>
     is a problem is that it can easily be gamed and has been for quite some time. It also doesn't adjust for another crazy shit that might happen until the next payment period. If the economy crashes in that time frame and you're still paying a super low interest rate because of a contractual agreement, the banks lose BIG TIME. Directly from Wikipedia on the "

The Libor is supposed to be the total assessment of the health of the financial system because if the banks being polled feel confident about the state of things, they report a low number and if the member banks feel a low degree of confidence in the financial system, they report a higher interest rate number."
      </em>
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     REMEMBER THIS, the interest rate  drops to low percentages when the market is confident or is looking to inject growth (like how it is now); the inverse happens when the market is fearful (higher rate = higher cost of borrowing money usually). This is like letting your buddy Good Guy Greg borrow 20 bucks versus your half-cousin twice removed, Scumbag Steve.
    </p>
    <p>
     The banks here would deliberately rig the interest rates between each other in order to get massive loans to profit from (they basically are making themselves appear like Good Guy Greg to everyone around them, when in reality they're stealing your wallet out your back pocket).
     <strong>

     I watched them talking about it live, I would be lying if I told you it was a thrilling piece of entertainment. Watch it if you're really curious and want to get a deeper understanding of what's at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
     ​
    </p>
    <p>
     What this means is SOFR will change how interest rates are calculated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet again in a very simple explanation:  if
     <strong>
      Libor
     </strong>
     is "forward-looking" meaning you get an interest rate ahead of time (you know exactly what your payment will be) -
     <strong>
      SOFR
     </strong>
     is the inverse, meaning it's "backward-looking".
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT BANKS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS WILL NOT KNOW WHAT THEIR MONTHLY PAYMENT FOR THEIR LOAN WILL BE(for example) UNTIL THE DAY OF PAYMENT (
     </strong>
     From reading I believe it's about 5 days prior, I could be wrong)
     <strong>
      . THIS IMPLIES THAT THE RATE THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY FLUCTUATES ON A DAILY BASIS. THIS DAILY FLUCTUATION WILL BE BASED OFF THE
     </strong>

     .  This transition is expected to be completed by 2023, however no new contracts can be written under Libor as of...

    <img src="img/6m5o0b3oflt61.png"/>
    <p>
     This solves two things:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      If the market fluctuates in the time that a loan was given, the banks will not be put into a vulnerable position nor profit from it. Think of this as a "we ride together, we die together" type of scenario. They'll be impacted as much as any of us should the market take a down turn or rise.
     </li>
     <li>
      The rates can no longer be gamed as easily because they're no longer based off self-report data, but rather the rate of the daily treasury yield on the market.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     Now here's the thing, we should've already started transitioning to this new system over quite some time. The fed wanted all the new loans being given out in the last year to be already implemented through SOFR, but instead the banks chose to STILL tie them to
     <strong>
      Libor
     </strong>
     . But wait a minute some of these are 3-year, 5-year loans; but
     <strong>
      Libor
     </strong>
     will only be around for another 2 years. Sounds like it can be another problem in the making and the banks don't want to face reality yet.
     <strong>
      Knowing this it's not surprising they posted such great earnings right? Easy to make the picture look pretty when it's full of shit.

     LONG STORY SHORT; THEY'RE WORRIED THAT WHEN BANKS AND BUSINESSES ARE FORCED TO PAY THE ACTUAL RATES OF THE MARKET (and not their made up ones) BECAUSE OF THE LIBOR -&gt; SOFR TRANSITION, THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE CASH ON HAND TO MEET THE
     <strong>
      SOFR
     </strong>
     REQUIREMENTS AND RUN INTO SERIOUS FUCKING TROUBLE. THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED ALREADY IN 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      NOT ONLY THIS, THE PEOPLE WHO BORROWED MONEY WILL BE STRESS TESTED ON A REGULAR BASIS (think monthly/quarterly) TO SEE IF THEY ACTUALLY CAN SUPPORT A HIGHER INTEREST RATE SHOULD THE MARKET GO TO SHIT. Once again no new contracts can be written under Libor as of...

      (once again still in a Libor system). This would also explain why BlackRock is the heaviest in cash they've ever been. The reintroduction of Gary Gensler during this timeframe, is a concerning one as he dealt with the 2008 crash once before which involved LIBOR.

      My Opinion: I believe that many of the "bad" hedge funds, took on massive risks with expectations that the 7rump administration would get re-elected and prolong the need for transitioning to SOFR and others (involving the former SEC + CFTC chairmen). This would give them ample amount of time to make profits on the companies (and banks?) they bankrupt.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     It appears to me that they didn't properly hedge their risk for any other outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now lets have a look at who might have abused the low interest rates fabricated by banks, and provided collateral with rehypothecated assets?
    </p>
    <p>
     Well a good place to start looking is to see who's grown the most in the last year.

     thesis here. I believe Hedge Funds have been taking advantage of the low interest rates that are being gamed. They decide they're going to take this to a whole new extreme through rehypothecation and the repo market.
    </p>
    <p>
     MY OPINION: THIS IS MONEY THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO PAY BACK. CITADEL AND FRIENDS ASPIRED TO REACH THE GRAND SIZE THAT THE LIKES OF BLACKROCK AND VANGUARD ARE THROUGH ANY MEANS NECESSARY. I BELIEVE THEY'VE TAKEN ON MASSIVE RISK AND ARE NOW BEING CLOSED IN ON BY THE DTCC + THE SEC WITH THE SOFR ADJUSTMENT.
    </p>
    <p>
     THEY'VE PUT MULTIPLE BANKS AT HUGE RISK A BLOWING UP ON FAKE BONDS --- IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOFR DROPS THE BOMB ON THEM. I believe this is the reason why BlackRock and Co have been pushing for "max pain" each week; this is so that it makes it impossible to keep up with SOFR interest rate requirements.

     As time progresses I believe we will see more evidence of multiple parties attempting to deleverage their positions before 2023. Coincidentally
     <strong>
      GameStop
     </strong>
     has just paid off all their debt that was due that exact year.
    </p>
    <p>
     So this becomes a two pronged problem;
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Assets are being rehypothecated which are being used as collateral
     </li>
     <li>
      Banks are providing absurd interest rates off the old LIBOR system instead of SOFR; this has resulted in the taking on a position that will be extremely difficult to get out of.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     As we can see they're fighting against these changes through politics, but it appears they've brought in
     <strong>
      Gary Gensler
     </strong>
     to kick some ass.
