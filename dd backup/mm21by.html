      There will likely be a major discount at 9:50am-10:00am tomorrow! Could go as low as 162, then it should recover quickly!

     This is the formula for calculating an option price "C". You can basically take the current price of options on the market, and do an iterative search to try and guess the volatility. The volatility affects "d1" and "d2".
    </p>
    <p>
     <img src="img/szeok562asr61.png"/>
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      C is the Option Premium
     </li>
     <li>
      S is the price of the stock

     So if you plug in all those numbers and know what C is, you can guess the IV and plug it into the equation until you get the right C.

     So a lot of my posts revolve around Implied Volatility. I figure you guys would be interested in learning how to calculate it and understand what causes IV to go up or down.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      I'll be extensively covering how IV is calculated in depth during my power hour stream today.
     </strong>
     It's a bit involved so I will use my whiteboard to go over how it all works.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm currently working on a script that can calculate option premiums and IV. It can also print out the greeks. Will include this in my stream if I get it fully working.

     New support added at 179. Haha at this rate I will have listed every single price GME has ever been at ;)
    </p>
    <p>
     On a more serious note, you can use a percentage based method and even bollinger bands to narrow in on 1 support that you think it will reach for the day. The multitude of lines are just there as options. It's ultimately up to the technical analyst to pick the ones that are significant for the day.

     IV seems to have bottomed out today. Very interesting... seems to have trouble going any lower. We're nearing pre January levels of IV. Ignore the weird gaps in volatility. That's caused by after hours trading. What I think has caused the uptick in IV is the moderately fast move downwards today. Remember that volatility goes up when the price moves fast. It's still rather slow today, but relatively faster than historical movements.
    </p>
    <img src="img/e1y8atxswrr61.png"/>
    <p>
     If we zoom out to a larger timescale, it would be pretty exceptional if we can drop down to circle 1's IV. However it seems like with the current level of volatility, we might be bottoming out at the same IV as circle two from before the January squeeze.

     Broader market turning around, headed downwards. Even though GME has negative beta, downwards market moves still tend to drag it down. It's more during PM and AH that GME inverts the market. What happens is HFTs go short biased during broader market downtrends, so GME can follow the broader market during HFT only trading hours like midday.

     As for 500 strike calls, these are 2022. Someone sold this

     Most of the downward movements today are on extremely low volume. I remember 2/24 was like this until things picked up mid day. From a technical perspective, it makes the most sense for long side to keep the IV crush going through the week.
    </p>
    <p>
     Could we see a larger move this week? It's possible because IV is already so low, however keep in mind that Max Pain for this week is higher than next. A larger move next week would make a lot more options expire worthless. Perhaps those large Put purchases yesterday was a setup for a 4/16 battle.

     It's certainly been very quiet yesterday. The lowest volume all week sitting at around 6 million. It's interesting to me that it's always on a Tuesday that we see some of the lowest volume trading days. On 2/24, a Wednesday, the stock exploded after a 7 million volume trading day.
