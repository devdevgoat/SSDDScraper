<content><p>A family member just sent me an article about Gamestop, and other "meme" stocks. Basically the article tries to spread FUD about investing in "meme" stocks, with Gamestop being the top of the list.</p>
<p>I read the article, but they provide no convincing arguments with regards to their title. What's interesting though, is that they have a chart showing how much money went into buying Gamestop from Korea. The figure is shown below:</p>
<p>​</p>
<p><img src="img/v0hveepdxlx61.png"/></p>
<p>This chart is in Korean, so let me break it down for you.</p>
<ol>
<li>The light-blue pointy thing with number on top shows how much money went into buying these stocks. For Gamestop, this amounts to 236,840,000 dollars (\~237 million dollars).</li>
<li>The triangles right below show the return on these investments, over the period 4/1/2021 \~ 5/5/2021</li>
<li>On the bottom right, the source is shown. <strong>The source listed is the KOREAN SECURITIES DEPOSITORY</strong>, which I believe is like the DTCC for Korea (someone please correct me if I'm wrong - although I'm Korean, I don't know much about the Korean system).</li>
</ol>
<p>So 237 million dollars from April 1st to May 5th, huh? Let's see how many shares that amounts to.</p>
<p>Let's just assume the average price was 160 dollars. To me, this is reasonable, since the stock has been mostly trading sideways since April. I think if you consider the average return of -16.7%, you could get a more accurate average, but let's just say 160 dollars for now.</p>
<p><strong>237 million dollars / 160 dollars per share \~= 1.48 million shares of Gamestop</strong></p>
<p>You may think: 1.48 million? That's not a lot...</p>
<p>But you have to remember: <strong>this is Korea ONLY</strong>. And Korea probably constitutes a very very very small portion of all GME shares. Plus, that's 5% of the free float (30M).  Imagine how many shares apes in the US hold, as well as our Europoors, and Aussiepoors, and other Asiapes. Of course, the number above only shows the total buy amount. But I think it's safe to assume that people who get into GME mostly buy and hold - at least it's true for me, and all fellow Korean ants around me (family and friends).</p>
<p>We own the float. We own the float multiple fucking times over.</p>
<p>GME to the moon.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Koreans alone have bought 1.48 million shares of GME since April Fools. Retail owns the float.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Edit: The data above shows "매수 결제액", which denotes <strong>the amount of money used in successful buy transactions</strong>. This is NOT the transaction amount in dollars, which would include sell amount as well. So it's a fact that 237 million dollars was used to buy GME since April. The only main assumption here is that the Korean Securities Depository provides accurate data, which I believe they do. Here is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_Securities_Depository">Wikipedia</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210507050739/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_Securities_Depository"> (wb)</a> page for what they do - I believe their role is similar to the DTCC</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>## Important Edit</p>
<p>Edit 2: To answer a few common questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, the number on the chart is in Dollars, not KRW. The left side of the figure says (달러) which is "Dollar" in Korean. The number, "2억3684만" is 236,840,000.</li>
<li>This figure does not provide any data for the sell amount. So we do not have data on this. But in my post, I state that I'm assuming most people in GME will hold. The reason for my assumption is that, most ordinary investors thought GME was done in January. BUT we have a lot of people who have looked into the research and concluded that GME is a good buy. If this was people FOMOing in in January, February, or even March, then I think this assumption would not hold. <strong>But we have seen no significant price action in April - so why buy, if you don't believe in the squeeze?</strong> Why would people FOMO in starting April? Media has been bashing GME, and volume has been mostly shit as well. That is why I think most people who bought in April are HODLing for the squeeze.</li>
<li>Will add more later.</li>
