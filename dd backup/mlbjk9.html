     Ending the day around 184.40, down 1.36%. Overall a good day for the bullish. IV crush continuing and setting up the ideal conditions for a gamma squeeze.

     183.5 support if we cross the current level.

     Small pullback on pretty low volume. Nothing too interesting.

     Basically due to the lack of fundamental catalysts, we are waiting patiently for forces behind the scenes to move the stock price. It's always eerily quiet during periods like right now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Forget options chain, forget TA, what's coming soon is a chain of business maneuvers that can push the price. So whether that be a share recall, a change in leadership, big business changes are underway. Eventually we'll likely walk out of the eye of the storm, and get flung into the sky and catch a rocket to the moon :D

     Sorry little crayon typo in edit 12. I drew the first circle on the wrong day, fixed it now!

     By eye of the storm, we were hit in January, turbulence in Feb, and now late March and early April seems to be the eye. It's always oddly quiet in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     My take on those 330 and 340 strike Put walls is perhaps those are post squeeze bets. You basically want to buy to open Puts during the lowest IV trading period so later you can sell to close during a high IV nosedive.

     Most likely will have to wait till power hour for any major movements. I'm expecting some action either Thursday or Friday, will be colliding horizontally with a major resistance line.

     Double top as expected. We should consolidate around VWAP.

     We bounced off the resistance, possibly a bull flag followed by a double top.

     Nothing crazy on optionsonar. &lt;100k orders mostly on OTM Puts.

     Volume still extremely low, expect mostly sideways action today.

     Descending channel with breakout to the upside. Nothing too interesting in options right now.

     Extremely low volume, 280k first minute candle. It's like the eye of the storm. Nothing too interesting happening right now.

     Possible resistance we might test later in the day.

      This is not a prediction, just a possibility.

     Added 186 support. Likely mini selloff touching 186 first minute candle, then small bounce.

     I sense a storm is coming. I hope you all went to Wendy's and got yourselves a nice meal, because this is gonna be a long car trip down a windy road before we reach our destination.
