     <strong>
      Hello Fellow Apes,
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     I am writing this post to let Apes know that I was able to follow-up through the SEC and the DTCC on
     <strong>
      SR-DTC-2021-005
     </strong>
     and to the follow-up on work in my initial post
     <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mzkf8v/where_is_srdtc2021005/">
      here

     , and providing you now with the status update I received.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      I would also like to report that the SEC and the DTCC once again were very gracious and timely in their responses.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     For those not familiar with
     <strong>
      SR-DTC-2021-005 and what it does.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      In short, SR-DTC-2021-005
     </strong>
     would limit the ability of market makers and hedge funds working together to reset FTD transactions and/or conceal short positions through nefarious options trading.
