     , the sister company of the Motley Fool.
    </p>
    <p>
     This company has several funds and ETFs on their site. So I took a look at the top holdings for each one then did a search on motley fool for their articles to see if they are upholding their mission to
     <a href="https://www.fool.com/legal/the-motley-fool-disclaimer/">
      help readers obtain financial information and discuss ways to make investment and personal financial decisions

     are just a propaganda machine to boost the stock prices of their holdings
     <strong>
      (spoiler alert: It's the propaganda one)
     </strong>
    </p>

     You can find their funds here:

     ----------
     <strong>
      #1 Holding: Amazon
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Amazon is their number 1 holding in their FOOLX fund
     </strong>
     but can be found at some % on most of them**.** And just take a look at the articles. literally they are banging out 3-4 articles A DAY saying how amazing Amazon is
    </p>

    <p>
     <strong>
      ---------- #2 Holding: Watso Inc.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     This is the
     <strong>
      number 1 holding in their TMFGX fund.
     </strong>
     I had never heard of this company, but motley fool has over 100 articles about it and once again all singing its praises.
    </p>

    <p>
     <strong>
      ---------- #3 Holding - Apple
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Apple is their
     <strong>
      number 1 holding in their motley fool 100 ETF (TMFC)
     </strong>
     and they actually
     <strong>
      wrote some negative articles
     </strong>
     about them...
     <strong>
      just kidding!
     </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
     <strong>
      ---------- GME
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     AAAAANNNNDDD now let's get to GME:

    <p>
     As you can see, not so great. They even did some comparisons between amazon, i wonder what they suggested...

     <strong>
      Now some of you may "wait, this seems like blatant market manipulation?" and if this was a just world then answer would be DUH!!!
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      BUTTTTT, at the bottom of their articles, they disclose that they do have a position in the stock (and even their call option recommendations...), its just in size 5 font after another long disclaimer.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      So at least they are nice enough to let you know they are manipulating you if you bother to read the fine print.
     </strong>

     <strong>
      Update:
     </strong>
     so i clicked on their disclosure policy
     <a href="https://www.fool.com/legal/fool-disclosure-policy/">
      https://www.fool.com/legal/fool-disclosure-policy/
     </a>

    <p>
     and also this from their disclaimer page
     <a href="https://www.fool.com/legal/the-motley-fool-disclaimer/">

     <strong>
      So funny that they say that they are not here to give you buy or sell recommendations when they literally say "Recommends Apple. The Motley Fool recommends the following options..."
     </strong>
    </p>
    <h1>
     So if you had any doubt about the purpose of motley fool, it is just propaganda to prop up their holdings and downplay any other company that could threaten them.
