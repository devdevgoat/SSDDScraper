      For people saying that there was a reverse split and that is not a good exemple. Can you provide your source stating this happening in august 2020? The only reverse split I see was in 2018 and thus is irrelevant. The price which shoot from $125 to $25'000 is still a "true price"

     <strong>
      TLDR:
     </strong>
     the ETN stock had a 45% short interest and 140'000 shares shorted (only that amount? strange isn't it? Some wrinkly ape to check all this please?). So it went from  $400 to $25,000. Do I need to remind you what situation is GME in? Spoiler: Much much much more shorted lol.

       It seems that there was no dip during the squeeze but I could only take a look with a 45 minutes scale.

        5 minutes scale
       </strong>
       ! Thank you u/majordanage Indead, there is one little dip before $25'000 that you could avoid by looking at the stoch RSI which was
       <strong>
        still
       </strong>
       being near 80.

     Edit4: Yes of course not every share sold for $25'000 sadly, so you juste have to hold even more. Only a few will get the max share's price... It is those who have diamond hands surely
    </p>
    <p>
     Edit5:  u/BeansMostly said something very interesting about the float. Take a look at the quote just below. Of course don't forget that we may own many many times the float which would ease the problem of having 70 millions shares instead of the 300k shares of DGAFZ.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      <em>
       There are 140k shares shorted in the ETN
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      Which according to the table in the article is \~46% of the float.
     </p>
     <p>
      So there were \~300k shares total in the float.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is much easier to control 300k shares than it is to control 70m. The number of players would be much smaller and encouraging continued holding would be much easier.
     </p>
     <p>
      This
      <em>
       does
      </em>
      show that it's possible though.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of course, it later states it had an average daily volume of only 8k shares. Their time to cover would have been astronomical compared to GME.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is important to recognize the things that make a scenario not work. That's how science gets done.
     </p>
     <p>
      That being said: look at that, a 25k squeeze. Nice.
     </p>

      Edit: this is all based on the first non-reddit link in your post

     Edit3: I don't know if it is illegal to ask this but can you also upvote the crosspost on r/GME ? It would be cool if everyone get to see this...
