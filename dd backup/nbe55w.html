<content><p>This post is simply putting few facts together and my own interpretation of what it means in the Squeeze to come. This is not a financial advice, just the opinion of a humble Ape with couple of wrinkles.</p>
<p>Mods, please review and flag as appropriate. Apes, feel free to comment, correct or debate. At the end of the day this is my opinion, not better than any of yours.</p>
<p>In this post, I am going to cover what is happening to the VIX, what is happening with the 10 Year treasury note, its link to inflation, and why all this is the beginning of the end of the GME saga, and I believe the squeeze is getting closer (no dates provided if that is what you are after, sorry).</p>
<p><strong>The VIX</strong></p>
<p>The VIX measures the volatility in the market, or how mad people think things are going to get. Since the beginning of the week, the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EVIX?p=%5eVIX&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch">VIX is up 40%</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210129000116/https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EVIX?p=^VIX&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch"> (wb)</a>. This reflects that the market is expecting a lot of uncertainty with more radical price movements. You can in this post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/naucr8/did_i_hear_that_right_margin_call/">HERE</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210608001833/https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/naucr8/did_i_hear_that_right_margin_call/"> (wb)</a> that even the smart money in Half Time doesn’t know whether to buy industrial or sell industrials. People do not know what they need to do. So increased uncertainty, hence increase volatility. In that video they even talk about margin calls, adding nervousness in the system, but I will cover this a bit later.</p>
<p>Remember few weeks back, someone bought 250k contracts of a 25/40 July call spread on the VIX. That was a 40m bet that the market would go crazy. At the time, it was speculated that this bet would be Dr Burry himself (would fit well on his way of investing) just before closing his twitter account. We will never know for sure, but someone with big pockets believe the market is going to go nuts. In the last couple of days, there has been a lot of unusual activity in the call options for the VIX, suggesting things are not going to get any more quiet, but even more volatile. (PS: I own X contracts of that 25/40 call too, printing over 40% as I write).</p>
<p>Net, the market is expecting a lot of volatility.</p>
<p><strong>The 10 year note</strong></p>
<p>Here you may need to grow a wrinkle, I hope I can ELI5 this.</p>
<p>The 10 year is basically the “risk free” asset against which any investment decision is made. I can invest in something, with an increased risk vs doing nothing, and that risk premium needs to be worth compared to the risk free asset, meaning the 10 year (or any US government bond like 30Y, 5Y…).</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the week, the 10 Year note as lost 7% of its value (the 5Y 13%!). that means the 10 year interest rate has gone up from 1.6% to 1.7%. the higher the interest rate, the lower the bond price, as cash flows over time are brought to today’s value with a higher discount rate.</p>
<p>Interest rates go up with 3 main drivers. Inflation, how risk free is the risk free asset itself and the FED.</p>
<p>· <strong>Risk Free</strong>: there is not such a thing as risk free asset. Any security would have 2 components of risk, systemic risk and specific risk. Very often in those useless congressional hearings, they talk about systemic risk, “hedge funds represent a systemic risk to the market”, “banks need to be well capitalized to avoid systemic risk”... Systemic risk is the risk of the system going to shit, the economy to collapse altogether…in other words, 2008. The fact that the 10 year note premium (its interest rate) goes up, is a reflection of increase risk in the system: “if risk free asset becomes riskier, then I want more return for my investment”. This links with the explosion of VIX: people perceive more risk in the system because of increased volatility expected, VIX goes up, interest rates go up.</p>
<p>· <strong>Inflation</strong>: inflation in macroeconomics is closely linked to interest rates. There are several type of inflation, but to keep it simple, if the amount of goods and service is the same in an economy but there is much more Dollars in circulation, then all goods and service will become more expensive, by simple supply and demand. A controlled inflation is good for an economy to grow, too much inflation dilutes people’s buying power and overall economy competitiveness in the international markets (high inflation countries see their currency devaluate). When inflation goes up, then your interest rates go up, as saving in your bank account at the reference interest rate should allow you to keep buying the same goods in a year time than today. How are your steemies doing? Over the last year, the US as created 30% of its debt, meaning, it has put a lot more dollars in the economy to recover from the pandemic, so naturally, inflation is increasing. look at the evolution of any commoditiy in the recent weeks. Last week, the announcement came of inflation being at 4.2% (which is twice what healthy inflation of around 2% would be).</p>
<p>· <strong>Enters the FED</strong>: The <a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2011/eb_11-12">FED mandate</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210514182430/https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2011/eb_11-12"> (wb)</a> is to drive full employment and maintain stable prices, so basically sells or buys bonds (issues or buy debt back) to put or remove liquidity in the system to ensure the economy can create growth, jobs and inflation is controlled. Last year, it pumped a lot of liquidity for the economy not to collapse, so effectively FED manipulates interest rates to deliver on its mandate. Inflation is a major risk for the FED, if inflation spikes, the FED will remove liquidity buy selling bonds and if inflation is low, it will buy bonds back and put money in the system. In the current context, FED continues to buy debt to fuel the economy with liquidity and manipulates the interest rates to avoid inflation. Problem is inflation is growing beyond where it should be, so sooner or later the FED will have to stop buying bonds and actually sell some back. Demand and supply, interest rates will up go, and more importantly for GME, bonds price will go down.</p>
<p>I am sure you all have read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/atobitt/">u/atobitt</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210513000421/https://www.reddit.com/user/atobitt"> (wb)</a> post of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/">The everything short</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210513035717/https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/"> (wb)</a>. There is a very important chart there about the collateral used in the repo market, where 67% of the collateral use for margin is US treasuries, and I am assuming most of it is the 10Y or the 5Y.</p>
<p>Also, here is a very interesting chart published by the WSJ on how margin debt works, and more importantly how much balances in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-margin-debt-works-11615136400">margin</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210513002113/https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-margin-debt-works-11615136400"> (wb)</a> accounts are. The number, 800 Billion dollars.</p>
<p>Let’s put it all together, shall we?</p>
<p>There are 800b in margin accounts, 67% of that uses US treasuries as collateral, US treasuries went down this week by 7% (assuming all 10Y, if combo of 5Y and 10Y it would be even more).</p>
<p>So simple math 800 * 67% *-7% = 37b… that is the amount, give or take few billions, that the banks have asked or are asking investors to put back to maintain their margin accounts….margin call hedgies!!!!</p>
<p>So what do they need to do? Sell their long positions to cover that margin call…so what would happen to the markets, they will drop…which is what has been happening this week to S&amp;P (-4%), Nasdaq (-5%) with companies like Tesla losing 13% this week, ARRK – 8%...</p>
<p>And here is where the domino starts. Not only hedgies need to put 7% more cash to cover their margin account, their long positions are also dropping 5% (in average, assumed), which in return means the banks will ask for more collateral, since the systemic risk is increasing (VIX), the current collateral is losing value (increase rate for the 10Y) and the value of their holding is declining.</p>
<p>Add to that the fact that companies’ valuations (so the multiple of their sales or cash flows which reflect their market price) is based on the risk free asset for comparison, the higher the 10 year interest rate, the higher the premium needed to riskier assets (think of tech stocks with little profits and little cash flow today but higher expectations for the future), so the more the valuation of the company (its price) is overvalued when the 10Y goes up, so this will drive further corrections in the market.</p>
<p>The DTCC knows all this, hence why (I believe) they have been in a hurry to pass a lot of rules to protect themselves and made a liquidity test last month. Normally they only do that once a year, yet <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/n8s41o/dtcc_doing_another_liquidity_test_wasnt_the_last/">today they will do another one</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210510020545/https://i.redd.it/uqkek1upz6y61.jpg"> (wb)</a>. They are nervous, so back to the VIX.</p>
<p>There starts the domino for GME. As hedgies get margin call, sell long assets, stock price goes down, their remaining assets lose value and one or many will go bely up. Banks would have to liquidate that fund archegos style, closing their positions, making the price in the market to further drop, which increases the margin requirements for the remaining HF….vicious cycle. The weaker HFs will start falling. Considering the large amount of shorts in GME (with married puts so shorts made out of thin air) the moment one HF short GME and gets liquidated, it will trigger the buying pressure in the stonk. That will be the catalyst we need.</p>
<p>Worth pointing, AMC and GME are in the same boat. Not sure we have done the same level of diligence in AMC on how the FTDs are being hidden, but clearly the their price action is very similar, and so were their cost to borrow back in Jan with the first mini squeeze. Look at the cost to borrow of AMC today….it is up to 80%, similar to the level of January. We do not see the same in GME because of all the fuckery on the married puts and dark pools, but it is clearly an indication that something is about to go boom. And if AMC goes to the moon, soon after or at the same time GME will do the same.</p>
<p>We are up for a ride, and I sense the take off is getting closer.</p>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
<p>Volatility is exploding, market is nervous.</p>
<p>Interest rates are increasing, because of market inflation and increased risk (volatility)</p>
<p>Bonds are losing value on interest rate increasing, collaterals are worth less. Margin calls are happening.</p>
<p>It is a matter of time for the weaker HF to go belly up and trigger the MOASS.</p>

<p>Edit 2: fellow Ape posted as well on repo market and margin, confirmation bias for me. calls:<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nb9pon/european_financial_news_is_reporting_major_margin/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nb9pon/european_financial_news_is_reporting_major_margin/</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210513055732/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nb9pon/european_financial_news_is_reporting_major_margin/"> (wb)</a></p></content></body>
