<content><p>I posted this <strong>almost 2 months ago</strong> and folks thought I was wrong or fear mongering.  Look at all the DD now and tell me I'm wrong.  I wish I was wrong because this is a big deal as most of you have learned.  Either way, we are going to the fucking moon and beyond!!!  Enjoy your tendies when they come because you're going to be the apes who survived it and earned it for holding throughout all the bullshit so far.</p>
<p>I've only edited one part of the original post where I thought the date was going to be in early April but have now removed the date because putting a date to the moon is very bad.  I'll also update it with the great DD that has been uncovered which lends to my theory.  If you have more, send it my way and I'll update this post.</p>
<p><strong><em>ORIGINAL POST</em></strong></p>

<p>$GME will be squeezed and the market will crash. I said it and I will show you why I think it to be true.</p>
<p>The stock market will crash and crash hard. $GME and retailer investors will <strong>NOT</strong> be the reason for it but the catalyst and where blame will be put.</p>
<p>I'm not normally a "cup half empty" type of person but the evidence is there and I thought I would share.</p>

<p><strong>Overvaluation of Stocks</strong></p>

Not just $GME but right across the board.</p>
<p><strong>Record Low Interest Rates and Treasury Bonds</strong></p>
<p>The interest rates are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amydobson/2021/01/08/mortgage-interest-rates-slide-again-to-a-brand-new-record-low/?sh=75b54a6c60c4">incredibly low</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210222003315/https://www.forbes.com/sites/amydobson/2021/01/08/mortgage-interest-rates-slide-again-to-a-brand-new-record-low/?sh=75b54a6c60c4"> (wb)</a> and has been low for over 12 years with only a slight bump up pre-COVID. Low interest rates introduce risk to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/with-interest-rates-near-zero-preserving-retirement-income-gets-risky.html">retirement</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210318162636/https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/with-interest-rates-near-zero-preserving-retirement-income-gets-risky.html"> (wb)</a> income.

Although the fed has stated they won't be raising interest rates, it means banks won't experience it but consumers may see a spike in <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/12/heres-why-interest-rates-could-spike-in-2021/">mortgage and auto</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210202130917/https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/12/heres-why-interest-rates-could-spike-in-2021/"> (wb)</a> rates which are not directly influenced by the fed rate.</p>
<p><strong>SPAC Mania</strong></p>
<p>SPACS or <em>Special purpose acquisition companies</em> are companies which have no operating assets and are used to make private companies go public. They are basically "shell" companies or "blank check" companies. SPAC's raised <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/08/investing/wall-street-market-bubble-yusko/index.html">more money</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210428151122/https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/08/investing/wall-street-market-bubble-yusko/index.html"> (wb)</a> in the first 3 weeks of 2021 than all of 2019. SPAC's have been <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/spacs-look-like-a-bubble-within-a-bubble-5105202">claimed</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210227044904/https://www.investopedia.com/spacs-look-like-a-bubble-within-a-bubble-5105202"> (wb)</a> to be an indicator of a market bubble.</p>
<p><strong>ETF Volatility</strong></p>
<p>ETF's are generally stable places for investors and don't normally see volatility. When ETF's see <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/464d8d78-a843-11e7-ab66-21cc87a2edde">volatility</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210222003321/https://www.ft.com/content/464d8d78-a843-11e7-ab66-21cc87a2edde"> (wb)</a>, it's an indicator of an unstable market. With GameStop, we saw a lot of Due Diligence on Reddit that ETF's were being shorted to cover the existing shorts.</p>
<p><strong>GameStop as a Catalyst</strong></p>
<p>There are already fingers being pointed at the mini-squeeze by retail investors of GameStop in Jan 2021 as causing instability in the market. News <a href="https://detroit.cbslocal.com/2021/01/28/gamestop-price-stock-market-bubble-optimism/">articles</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210405025413/https://detroit.cbslocal.com/2021/01/28/gamestop-price-stock-market-bubble-optimism/"> (wb)</a> are now appearing to link a market bubble and GameStop. There are many such as this <a href="https://apnews.com/article/wall-street-worries-bubble-gamestop-1f6918bbe537f2cc40c8f4629423f08a">one</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210303134958/https://apnews.com/article/wall-street-worries-bubble-gamestop-1f6918bbe537f2cc40c8f4629423f08a"> (wb)</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/02/12/is-the-stock-market-about-to-crash/?sh=856d1d571dee">this one</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210222003309/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/02/12/is-the-stock-market-about-to-crash/?sh=856d1d571dee"> (wb)</a>, and even international news articles such as <a href="https://gulfnews.com/your-money/saving-investment/signs-point-to-an-imminent-stock-market-crash--how-can-you-protect-your-investments-1.1612103834934">this</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210305112049/https://gulfnews.com/your-money/saving-investment/signs-point-to-an-imminent-stock-market-crash--how-can-you-protect-your-investments-1.1612103834934"> (wb)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion and Opinion</strong></p>
<p>The market was moving towards a crash even without GameStop but when it does finally squeeze, it will be felt throughout the markets which were already on the way. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g8PawZIRrk">video</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210315160708/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g8PawZIRrk"> (wb)</a> also provides other indicators of a market crash.</p>
<p><strong><em>My opinion of what would happen next:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>GME will squeeze. <em>(date removed).</em></li>
<li>Market bubble will pop.</li>
<li>Crypto will also take a dive. (There are many institutions now invested in crypto which will need the liquidity to recover or take a new position. Also a good opportunity to buy a crypto dip).</li>
<li>The US dollar will trend downwards, with gold and other precious metals going up.</li>
<li>Government will intervene.</li>
<li>New regulations and other unrelated laws because "you never let a crisis go to waste".</li>
<li>We apes enjoy our tendies and the bad press coverage.</li>
