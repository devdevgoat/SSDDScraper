     <strong>
      EDIT 3: THIS SHOULD BE TAKEN AS GOOD NEWS!!!
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     The initial concern was that GameStop sold a bunch of bonds that have the option to convert into shares of common stock.
    </p>
    <p>
     ​
    </p>
    <p>
     This means an owner of GameStop's bond can convert (under certain circumstances) into shares of GME to cover a large short position, without being traded on the market.
    </p>
    <p>
     ​
    </p>
    <p>
     I have been informed by a few people that they
     <strong>
      do not have a currently have CONVERTIBLE BONDS
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     This would have been a VERY VERY SNEAKY way for short sellers to cover their asses without us knowing from the stock market.

     Can't believe I didn't think of this sooner....
    </p>
    <p>
     u/the_captain_slog any help here? Know anything off the top of your head?

     A
     <strong>
      convertible bond
     </strong>
     is a fixed-income corporate
     <strong>
      debt
     </strong>
     security that yields interest payments, but can be converted into a predetermined number of common stock or equity shares. The conversion from the
     <strong>
      bond
     </strong>
     to stock can be done at certain times during the
     <strong>
      bond's
     </strong>
     life and is usually at the discretion of the bondholder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Anyone know a thing or two about the corporate bond market? Can we objectively calculate this exposure?
    </p>

     I know BlackRock is buying a sh*t lod of corporate bonds because I incorrectly stated they were buying TBonds. Could literally mean a HUGE margin call through BlackRock when they convert those bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wonder how many of those are convertible?
    </p>

     EDIT 1: Or BlackRock and other bond holders could be converting them into shares and paying the HFs back. But they would be doing it outside of the market.
    </p>
    <p>
     Q: Wondering if these are the "blips" we see in AH trading?
