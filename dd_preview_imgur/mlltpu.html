<body><h1>Today was the lowest volume trading day since January 12! The last two times GME had such low volumes (both of which also occurred on a Tuesday), we saw huge volume on the next day. What will we see tomorrow??? 🚀🚀🚀</h1>

<content><p>Hi fellow apes 🦍🦍🦍and welcome to Superstonk!</p>
<p>With these volumes, It looks like everyone took a nap today! Let's take a look at the historical volumes and any relations we can see with share price changes.</p>
<p>---------- <strong>BOILERPLATE:</strong></p>
<p>I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀</p>
<p><strong>TLDR: Today was the lowest volume trading day since  Tuesday January 12 (when the price $19.95)! Historically we have seen huge volume trading days (and big price gains) on the Wednesday and guess what tomorrow is???💎✋🚀🚀🚀</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: I am not suggesting that it will moon tomorrow, just that we could see a good spike in volume and price.</strong></p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>Below is the data for GME from Jan 4 to April 6:</p>
<p><a href="https://1drv.ms/x/s!AomFEIhCN8icgt1xPEpeIuja-2QEoA?e=DSIem9">Here is a link to the data table if you want to have fun :)</a> </p>

<p>I bolded the days with significantly low volume before we then saw huge volume days.</p>
<p>The first was <strong>Tuesday Jan 12</strong> with only 7m vol. On <strong>Wednesday</strong>, we saw 144m vol and 57% increase in price</p>
<p>The second time was <strong>Tuesday Feb 23</strong> with only 7.5m vol. On <strong>Wednesday</strong> we saw 83m vol and 104% price increase</p>
<p>Today, <strong>Tuesday April 6</strong> we saw 6m in vol. <strong>What will we see tomorrow???</strong></p>
<p>Also interesting to note, it was <strong>27 trading days between the first two low volume days</strong>, and <strong>28 days between the second and today,</strong> this almost sounds like <strong>a trend....</strong></p>
<p><strong>---------- Available Shares to borrow</strong></p>
<p>Another interesting note, today we saw a <strong>huge increase in the availability of shares to borrow</strong> (from 80k to 950k) through <a href="https://iborrowdesk.com">iborrowdesk.com</a>.</p>
<p>You can also see that a sharp <strong>increase in the number of shares available to borrow</strong>  also happened on <strong>Feb 23rd</strong>, increasing by <strong>900,000 in 1 day</strong>... <strong>how many did it go up by today?</strong></p>
<p>​</p>
<p><strong>---------- TLDR</strong></p>
<p><strong>TLDR: Today was the lowest volume trading day since  Tuesday January 12 (when the price $19.95)! Historically we have seen huge volume trading days (and big price gains) on the next day (Wednesday) after a low volume Tuesday.  What will tomorrow bring???💎✋🚀🚀🚀</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: I am not suggesting that it will moon tomorrow, just that we could see a good spike in volume and price.</strong></p>
