<content><p>Apes- first, this is not financial advice, I have been snorting crayons non-stop for 48 hours straight and am about to go full-on RICK JAMES, BITCH mode all over your couch. üñç</p>

<p>If you or your parents have their retirement accounts <strong>PASSIVELY MANAGED BY BIG BANKS OR INSTITUTIONS</strong>, as opposed to actively-manages funds or having independent financial advisors, PLEASE LISTEN.  A passively managed account <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/what-difference-between-passive-and-active-portfolio-management.asp">explained by investopedia here</a> means the bank or institution will invest your savings "according to a strategy" instead of you having full control:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An <em>actively</em> managed investment fund has an individual portfolio¬†manager,  co-managers, or a team of managers all making investment decisions for  the fund. The success of the fund depends on in-depth research, market  forecasting, and the expertise of the management team.  </p>
<p>A <strong><em>passive strategy</em></strong> does not have a management team making investment decisions and can be structured as an exchange-traded fund (ETF), a mutual fund, or a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uit.asp">unit investment trust</a>.  </p>
<p>Index funds are branded as passively managed rather than unmanaged because each has a portfolio manager who is in charge of replicating the index.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Passive strategies are not "actively managed" for best results, but people trust that big banks have the smartest minds managing portfolios, and "<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp">fiduciary obligations</a>" will require them to use those minds to act in my best interests, right??</p>

<p>Well, over the past 4 months of intense brain wrinkling, I learned that many brilliant minds think that a market crash is unavoidable in the near future. <a href="https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1362635795052421123">As he states here,</a> <strong>Dr. Brrrrry believes that a market crash is inevitable, inflation will happen, and both b$tco$n and gold will suffer due to governments directly competing with them for currency.</strong> <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/01/the-feds-tipsy-portfolio-and-inflation-expectations/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">He linked to an article here on TIPS,</a> "treasury inflation-protected securities." It explains that they may not be safe from inflation after all <em>and</em> the Fed is buying up almost all of what the Treasury is issuing.  <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/default.htm">About 1/5th of <strong>ALL</strong> U.S. dollars currently in existence were printed last year</a>, and the <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/1381/debt-to-gdp-ratio-historical-chart">debt-to-GDP ratio is near its historical high</a>, having jumped from 107% to 129% <em>in the last year alone.</em>  That's <em>as big of an increase as 2009-2020</em>- all in the last year.  <a href="https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics">Margin debt carried by big banks</a> is up almost double from last year and near historical highs, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.  The <a href="https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/quarterly-report-on-bank-trading-and-derivatives-activities/index-quarterly-report-on-bank-trading-and-derivatives-activities.html">Q4 Report on Bank Trading and Derivatives Activities</a> shows the big banks are currently trading, mainly with derivatives bought on margin debt....</p>

<p>Reading is really hard so I had to use my crayons, but that says banks own over $163 <strong>T</strong>rillion in derivatives based on $19 Trillion of assets, and <em>Holding Companies</em> own over $218 <strong>T</strong>rillion in derivatives based on $17 Trillion of assets.  <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-money-and-markets-in-one-visualization-2020/">Check out an infographic on all of the world's money here</a> if you want, I can't add that high.</p>
<p>Dr. Brrrry posted the following chart on investments that have historically protected one from inflation by rising in value directly proportional to amount of inflation, <a href="https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1363909572243705859">source:</a></p>
<p><img src="img/k45f7mjcx3u61.png"/></p>
<p>The Q4 filings showing what Warren Buffet has been up to convinced me that all of this is real, <a href="https://www.dataroma.com/m/m_activity.php?m=BRK&amp;typ=a">summarized on this webpage.</a>  Buffet, the guy who says "our favorite holding period is forever" and has always loved bank stocks, just sold huge amounts of stock- 100% out of some positions- here are some of the biggest sells:</p>
<p><img src="img/e5hh3selx3u61.png"/></p>
<p><img src="img/ikn5wzdmx3u61.png"/></p>
<p><img src="img/o1tzshbnx3u61.png"/></p>
<p>He made some very significant buys as well:</p>
<p><img src="img/qerodihpx3u61.png"/></p>
<p><img src="img/8mc5mywqx3u61.png"/></p>
<p>His buys match up nearly perfectly with things that rise in value along with inflation according to Dr. Brrrrry's table.  His sells match up nearly perfectly with all the banks and companies that will suffer if Brrrry's thesis about debt bubble bursting + inflation is correct.  <em>Including selling off 100% of his position in gold.</em></p>
<h1>fuuuuuuuucccccccckkkkkkk.</h1>
<p>Biases fully confirmed, I called my parents to warn them of things to come. (I posted that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/mt6fiq/psa_call_your_parents_and_ask_them_if_their/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">here</a>.)  My experience was unsettling- I learned that their retirement savings were in passively managed accounts through large institutions.  My mom had chosen how "risky" she wanted her investments to be- she chose a 50/50 plan, she said- and let the institution allocate accordingly.</p>
<p>Turns out her investments are in 60% stocks, <strong>40% bonds.</strong>  My dad has even more in bonds than that.  I realize that this is a very common investment strategy for retirement funds, and in most markets provides a dependable, unchanging amount of money back-per-investment.</p>
<p>Dependable, unless you're concerned about a market crash, inflation, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/flood-of-new-debt-tests-bond-market-11615372201">major dilution of the bonds market.</a></p>
<h1>BONDS WILL NOT PROTECT INVESTMENTS AGAINST INFLATION.  BONDS DEPRECIATE 1:1 WITH THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR.</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.fidelity.com.hk/en/start-investing/learn-about-investing/bond-investing-made-simple/how-interest-rates-affect-bonds">This Hong Kong fidelity website does a surprisingly nice job of explaining this further.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"Often called the ‚Äòenemy of the bond investor‚Äô, rising inflation erodes the value of bonds and makes their coupon payments less appealing, if interest rates remain constant or rise."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, end of Feb 2021- <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/01/buffett-says-bonds-are-dead-if-hes-right-heres-what-it-means-for-investors.html">Warren Buffet has publicly stated that "bonds are dead."</a> He did that in his <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/27/warren-buffetts-2020-shareholder-letter-highlights.html?&amp;qsearchterm=warren%20buffett">annual shareholder's letter</a> this year. (Thanks u/arikah and u/theslipguy!!) Other easily digestible material for our relatives: Youtube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28qXCqGx90E">BRIEF explanation of why Buffet hates bonds</a> by Bloomberg news.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DgfBIxsPIk">Youtube, Buffet hates bonds, reaching for yield is stupid, but human</a>.   Youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ue4Cds8tVg">Mohamed El-Erain explains Buffet's hatred of bonds</a> in his last shareholder's letter.</p>
<p>I then learned that my <em>husband's</em> parents employ an independent financial advisor to "actively manage" their retirement funds, paid on commission based on their fund's performance.  That advisor had moved his parents' funds <em>almost entirely out of bonds,</em> <strong><em>and started doing so over four years ago.</em></strong>  Neither of his parents work any more- they're entirely dependent on that money for the rest of their lives- it's not something they would take any risks with.  Knowing that, their advisor <em>still</em> made this move <em>and</em> went so far as to give his parents a book, <a href="https://prezi.com/nwnd3jgtqff5/be-an-owner-not-a-loaner/">"Be an Owner, Not a Loaner"</a>, explaining the difference between how bonds and stocks would retain value based on current market conditions.</p>
<p>Yet here were <em>my</em> parents, having chosen low levels of risk, having their money being invested in <strong><em>40%+ in bonds.</em></strong></p>
<p>If you check out <a href="https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/retirement-insights/guide-to-retirement/">J.P. Morgan's retirement guide here,</a> they actually recommend a portfolio of <strong>60% bonds</strong> if you have "medium-term goals" like college or home loans.</p>
<p><img src="img/fjqxcegux3u61.png"/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/fund-literature/brochure/brochure-model-portfolio.pdf?sa=n&amp;rd=n">Goldman Sach's retirement guide</a> is similar, explaining that the lowest-risk portfolios are those with the most money into bonds.</p>
<p><img src="img/0q8igmowx3u61.png"/></p>
<p>So.... according to the sacks at Sachs, my husband's retired parents have their money in the "highest risk" portfolio possible.  Which doesn't make sense based on everything I know and have linked above, <em>especially</em> if there's a debt bubble about to burst, and one good catalyst could trigger it.</p>
<p>Then I happen to see this news posted: <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/goldman-sachs-bank-america-jpmorgan-bonds-dividends-51618602441"><strong>3 big banks hold largest bond sales ever this week.</strong></a>  Bank of america sold $15 billion worth, JP Morgan sold $13 billion worth, and Goldman Sachs sold $6 billion.  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-15/jpmorgan-to-sell-13-billion-of-bonds-in-largest-bank-sale-ever">This Bloomberg article goes on to explain:</a></p>

<p>Strong correlation between debt over-exposure and the banks that Warren Buffet sold 100% of.  So- why are banks rapidly unloading debt while <strong><em>clearly</em></strong> over-leveraged to debt while <strong><em>keeping</em></strong> debt in their <em>"low-risk"</em> retirement funds?  Fiduciary responsibility my ass...</p>
<h1>TLDR: make your own conclusions based on the facts above.  I will be calling ape-mom and ape-dad about getting their retirement savings the hell out of bonds.</h1>
<p><strong>EDITZ additions:</strong>  Many apes want to know the best retirement strat moving forward, and in my eternal quest to be a helpful little ape, I'll post here what <em>warren the motherfucking goat buffet</em> suggests you do with your tendies: <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/warren-buffett-90-10-retirement-strategy-4159839">90/10 Buffet retirement strat.</a>  It comes in <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/90-10-strategy.asp">an investopedia-flavored version</a> as well.</p>
<p><strong>As to what stocks/index funds to look at? Take a look at stock in commodities and commodities index funds.</strong> Top of Brrrrry's list of things that hold value during inflation.

<p>I'd also personally be pretty comfortable investing in BRK.B and letting Buffet do the brain-work üòÜ</p>
<p><strong>Infoz about GOLD:</strong>  this is complicated and I won't pretend there aren't many different factors that will affect the price.  <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/071414/when-and-why-do-gold-prices-plummet.asp">Investopedia page on what makes gold plummet.</a>  Also, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mtxtib/crayonbrained_manifesto_banks_are_unloading_their/gv3cynn?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">an awesome wrinkle-brained comment here</a> by u/kavaman68 points out that big banks can heavily manipulate the price of gold.
