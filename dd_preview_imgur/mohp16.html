<content><p>Disclaimer: I am an ape who just learned how to form complete sentences. Please provide any counter evidence to the following theory.</p>
<p>There's a lot out there that the 49% loss on Melvin seems sus in regards to timing and the seemingly "too good news" especially with the way things have been going. Several OPs suggest that this could be a distraction or a setup for a fake squeeze soon. Both are entirely plausible and I am currently attempting to scour additional records to see if something was swept under the rug and not picked up by MSM.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I have another plausible theory. Anybody notice that the SEC rewarded 2.5M to a whistleblower Friday which corresponds to the release of this terribly embarrassing information. If you look on the SEC website, there is an interesting excerpt from the press release.</p>
<p>“The whistleblower in this matter provided key evidence that supported charges related to a breach of <strong>fiduciary duties owed to investors</strong>,”</p>
<p>Fiduciary duties means legal duty to act in the best interest of investors, including reporting significant losses.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was <strong>more than one</strong> individual who were awarded on Friday. If you look on the SEC website, you will actually see 2 documents with sequential file numbers but with <strong>identical wording</strong> and heavy redactions.  We saw the 2.5M award but the other individual was awarded 30% of an undisclosed amount.</p>

<p>Additionally, this series of awards are related to fraud towards <strong>RETAIL INVESTORS SPECIFICALLY</strong> (taken from the first document)</p>
<p>"Claimant provided new, detailed and firsthand information that significantly contributed to the Commission’s ongoing investigation, including critical documents. Claimant also provided continuing assistance to Commission staff, which helped the Commission shut down an ongoing <strong>offering fraud preying on retail investors</strong>. There also have been no collections to date."</p>
<p>It is entirely possible that Melvin was planning on not reporting this loss and the whistleblowers forced their hand. Crazy theory, but not out of the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>I will continue to scour the records for anything else.</p>
<p>Edit 1: So ill add in a few good counterpoints from the comments. These whistle-blower may have more to do with the $227M Ponzi scheme whose orchestrater was arrested on Monday of last week, not related to Melvin. Also It definitely makes sense that an whistle-blower award would not be paid out on the same day as typically these are paid out at the end of an investigation. Always appreciate some help loosening my tin foil hat.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Added disclaimer at top.</p></content></body>
