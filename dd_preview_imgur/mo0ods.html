<content><p>It just occurred to me...</p>
<p>They're not reporting 49% loss on the short position itself.</p>
<p>Because like they say you dont lose til you sell. And if they covered, they'd have lost a lot more. The number 49% makes no sense to me as a short position loss the more I think about it. Because it would bankrupt them. They'd be -1000% not -49%</p>
<p>This occurred to me battling shills. So thank you shills. Once again you fucked yourselves up by not giving up ðŸ˜‚</p>
<p>They're reporting a cash loss.</p>
<p>The cash loss is the interest fees on the short position..........</p>
<p>They lost 49% on the INTEREST FEES ALONE.</p>
<p>That's my theory. Does it make sense?</p>
<p>Edit: anonymous all seeing eye award. Someone sees the Deep Fucking Value of this theory.</p></content></body>
