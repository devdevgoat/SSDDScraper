<content><p>Edit#6 if you can read this before commenting. This has fucking nothing to do with Jordan beyond proving his bullshit move on from gme dead wrong</p>
<p>Before I cover this topic I need to first mention two things number one not financial advice two one of the major plot points I use has been slightly covered but I plan to dive into different correlations between this plot point and how it actually ties to the market.</p>
<p>Number 1 if you are a amc holder you are in for a shitty ride. I love you amc apes and hope that your rockets take off but this is going to possibly fuck with your bias and make gme haunt you. Gme is quite literally the neo of the stock market currently.</p>
<p>Number 2 if you hold any other meme stock I am going to be fucking with your confirmation bias with some evidence as to why gme is quite literally the only holy mother grail of all omfg I can’t believe how stupid rich I am about to be.</p>
<p>Now before other meme stock holders attack me I want you to truly question yourself. If technicals don’t line up for you do not attack the person presenting the technicals. I want all apes on the best possible rocket for their tendies. If the Dd presented here makes you lose conviction then you put your money in a I’ll thought out spot to begin with. 😈 there is nothing wrong with daddy I can promise you that he forgives and forgets.</p>
<p>To my true fucking apes my diamond handies my I took a ninety percent lick and stayed my god first I want to say congrats and second jesus your fucking tears of paper losses are about to be fucking swept away from wind air inertia when this lift off happens.</p>
<p>First small coverage here. Total ownership of finra report. 22 percent funds 192 percent institutions and of course we can’t forget our insider ownership at 24 percent.<br/>
     We add these stupid fucking numbers together and what do we get 238% ownership of outstanding shares. Now Bloomberg says institutions only own 140% so I will split the bill with them and take 26% off total. Leaves gme with 212% ownership now that isn’t a fucking meme that isn’t a joke that isn’t a fools errand that is pure government and legally binded reported data.</p>
<pre><code>Now some perspective that is of outstanding float. So minimum we are looking at a current reported issue of 149 million shares where only 69 mil exists.
</code></pre>
<p>SURPRISE BITCH only 54 mil can trade. 
SURPRISE BITCH also etfs can’t actually release shares again now since rebalance to settle gme the stock problem so take another 16 million off of that</p>
<p>So there are 38 million shares that are supposed to trade on the open market for gme. 149 reported owned. Take out the non tradeable locked shares in etfs and insiders from that (33) meaning 116 million shares.</p>
<p>So in short just in institutions you have 116 million shares that have to be turned into 38 million (sooner or later you fucking cuck sucking hedgies sooner or later) </p>
<p>That is a realized working short interest problem of around 300% </p>
<p>SURPRISE YOU DUMB FUCKING BITCH AGAIN
We haven’t even talked about the fucking elephant in the room the real whale the fucking stock picking confident DuMb MoNeY mother fuckers that just so happen to love the stock and refuse to sell before alpha Centauri,RETAIL. You guessed it retail. The tendie eating crayon snorting fucking degenerates that hold a fucking stupid amount of shares.</p>
<p>Now as we all know and I should not have to fill you in we don’t actually know how many shares we own. What do we know 10 million wsb idiots. 240 thousand gme god tier Dd pumping kings and 160 severely loyal to the stock diamond never paper handed a single share superstonkers.</p>
<p>Now I will be so unbelievably generous in my guess here that of the ten million people everyone owns a stupid small amount of just five shares. (Kids with summer jobs own more but I will let the hedgies quite literally blow there own head off with a small time guess) (I and many of the people in my personal circle own thousands of shares a piece I don’t say this to brag I don’t say this to boast I say this to be transparent that I do in fact hold a position in gme so you can take everything I say as my own self fulfilling confirmation bias)</p>
<p>Now so we can all agree (or maybe you think the total is less maybe you believe it to be more you see I split the middle here so as not to get to hung up on the discrepancies) either Way throw retail into the mix. You just added a new realized total to the problem of a additional 120%</p>
<p>What a fucking coinencedensce. We now have a realized short interest that is 420% percent.</p>
<p>Crazy Charlesswab is margin requiring 300 percent isn’t it🧐🧐.</p>
<p>Now the beautiful icing on top is you guessed it the options market. There is an addition in the money problem of another 50 million shares on calls (it only gets worse once this goes up. This is a unrealized problem because no one truly knows how many will be executed options writers may get off with just writing disgusting checks to some people and not have to really go through the headache of buying all of them.</p>
<p>(That would add an additional 120% up to a additional 300% if we get to 800$c)</p>
<p>Let’s take the option writers off the table for write now because we don’t even need them so for everyone so fucking worried about calls and puts and that effecting the moass congrats they don’t EVEN FUCKING MATTER. They are irrelevant they quite literally only talk about options in hopes you waste more money there then on real shares. They are just the icing on this fucking jacked to the tits cake.</p>
<p>Now as everyone continues to breed that doubt about wait what if hedges sell massive blocks first then squeeze never happens I bring to you one major fucking point!!!! A simple they quite literally can’t. But still value man your crazy what you talking about.</p>
<p>Allow me to explain. While their shares are on this infinity loop of being lent out they quite literally can’t sell a fucking thing. Why? Cause they no longer have it they would have to recall it to get it.</p>
<p>Edit: cause a bunch of cunts are in the comments saying they can sell to confuse you my powerful thorough bred fucktards all me to fill you in yes they can sell without having their share delivered to them. This sell creates a new synthetic long that is bought in lieu of you guessed it a fucking synthetic short. The people arguing this are arguing a zero sum game the position literally stay the same or even worse if the recalled share isn’t actually returned. So it’s either equal or worse</p>
<p>In simple terms no matter what the person that buys the shares and doesn’t lend them out has current ownership of the shares. (If your using a cash account my god I can’t stress to you true autist enough that if this is your first time in the stock market do not use margin. For this particular event don’t use margin or your shares may be lent out) </p>
<p>So in short guess who has no fucking clue how to lend their shares and only knows how to buy. Youuuuu guessed it retail. Guess who can’t sell till you sell so their shares can be returned? Youuuu guessed it retail. Retail is the fucking whale you idiots. Retail may not move the market cause we don’t manipulate the market we don’t buy at the same time and shit or sell at the same time and shit like the cheating creature life sucking Wall Street about to be homeless feel what real works like cucks do.</p>
<p>So you are the last domino of the shares jumping they hit retail cash accounts and they freeze. Nobody behind you can sell until you sell so the shares can start being bought and sold to close out positions. </p>
<p>LET ME BE CLEAR rETAIL IS IN 100% CONTROL OF A 420% SHORT PROBLEM. Retail is the literal start of the selling until then there is 119 million share buying pressure behind your small guess of 50 million owned shares. The other parties are trying to hide the buying pressure from you by lattering the price down so you dumb fucking retail hands can get out the way as they massacre eachother. Don’t worry I have some proof that they haven’t even began to cover.and that they literally can’t until you sell I’m not just selling you shit and calling it a pie you fucking degenerates are about to be ignorantly rich.</p>
<p>This is why the squeeze is taking so long to play out. They literally lost to retail on a bankrupting market shaking level.</p>
<p>Your words don’t mean anything still value your sounding more like shill value you might say.</p>
<p>No worries my young fucking apes I am here to nurture you with sweet sweet confirmation bias of the gods. Again if you are another meme stock holder and don’t want your confirmation bias fucking destroyed I invite you to leave. 😈 or stay and see why gme is so fucking different it doesn’t make sense. Now if the government reported ownership and the options chains and the fidelity buy verse sell graph every single day being 3:1 or more now coupled with the fact that gme is the most held stock in every single European country besides two doesn’t speak to your confirmation bias alongside the fact that no other hedge funds can sell their shares till they have their shares(hence why they are trading back in forth only in the dark pools and not on the open market, cause they can’t risk retail grabbing that last 1 million shares they are using on high speed ping pong illegally) meaning you have to sell for them to be able to sell. Here is the last piece of your puzzle.</p>
<p>Spoken a long time ago were the words obv</p>
<p>On balance volume</p>
<p>Now I have been sitting here quietly watching and commenting and shitposting for a few months now having watched my graphs and having seen the discrepancy of ownership and short interest but guess what people can argue those points. People can say the 172 to 372 price hike still on td ameritrade end of March graph was a bug the random 600 million share volume at certain prices were a bug. They can say that well other stocks are over 100% ownership. Other stocks are heavily shorted. The bonds market this the market crash that.</p>
<p>But guess what apes (I wasn’t probably the first one to find this but I sure as fuck am going to be driving this home today tomorrow and everyday after) there is not one single other stock that has behaved as gme has on the obv scale. Now I tell you this with literally 100 plus market relevant stocks from all the meme stocks to all major commodities to tech stocks to small market cap stocks to even the sundial and palantr stocks even good old silver. But for the photos I will cover here I only want to cover a few extremely relevant stocks (I feel) and a market standard or two if you truly question that there is a stock out there similar to gme on this level please feel free to check obv on the 15000 tickers I give you my blessing. I spent days looking for one my self and couldn’t find one hence this post you find one call me out I will Venmo you a cookie.(it doesn’t exist you get no cookie)</p>
<p>For a few more of my smooth brains out there asking what exactly is implied by the obv when they see it in the photo. The obv measure past action as in its real not a forecast or a guess or a average it is past data. You can fucking mine it it is concrete. What it does is cover the volume compared to price increases and decreases. What the obv is clearly saying in gme case is we are tethered to a price higher then our already ATM and that when the wave of buying pressure comes in they will constantly be pushing the obv higher and tethering us to hirer prices. Tendie town is now literally a self fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>EDIT sorry it posted the tickers twice.</p>
<p>EDIT# 2 I was going to post all meme stocks but they literally all follow obv you can look them up if you don’t believe me.</p>
<p>Edit #3 make sure to scroll through the three double posted tickers to get to the GameStop website ticker for the last cherry of confirmation bias</p>
<p>[Gme compared to other stocks obv. plus a little bonus](https://imgur.com/gallery/nPI4Co6</p>
<p>Edit#4 forgot parsar shows instant reverse to 206. Also extremely over sold on 90 day chart for rsi and stochastic </p>
<p>Edit#7 to people saying I am shilling this that the other because I am not for amc anymore. Let me be clear I think amc will squeeze as well. But ta for amc and the short positions for amc and the fact that Wanda is openly unwinding and that amc wants to issue 500mil shares and amc is serious fucking debt tied to a covid play and can be shut down at any moment is why I don’t believe it will do anything like gme. I had said if you didn’t want your confirmation bias fucked with leave. I didn’t even want to post this but yal spam protecting amc. And the icing on the cake is gme and amc have decoupled eachother on the obv showing to me on a past tense measure beyond gme turning around cash heavy big management change management that cares a solid non covid new infrastructure play amc just isn’t like gme. Gme with go to untold fucking places and amc IN MY FUCKINg OPINION BASED ON THE AFFOREMENTiONED IS THAT. Also Jordan was pumping amc then went on treys crush amc down then crush gme just feels like amc is a distraction they have ammo in and the obv shows they have no ammo in gme</p>

<p>Last fucking edit if any one is trying to argue in the comments about this only being a 300% short problem instead of a 420% short problem that number one shows you they are shill number two trying to spread doubt when both positions are equally fucked</p>
